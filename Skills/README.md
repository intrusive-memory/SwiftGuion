# SwiftGuion AI Skills

This directory contains AI assistant skills for working with the SwiftGuion library. These skills help AI coding assistants (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) provide better support for screenplay parsing, SwiftData integration, and screenplay analysis tasks.

## What Are AI Skills?

AI skills are structured documentation and prompts that help AI assistants understand:

- **Domain-specific concepts** (screenplay parsing, SwiftData integration)
- **Common workflows** (import/export pipelines)
- **Best practices** (error handling, performance optimization)
- **Code patterns** (ready-to-use examples)

By providing this context, AI assistants can generate better code, catch common mistakes, and follow established patterns.

## Available Skills

### üìù Screenplay SwiftData Import/Export

**Directory**: `screenplay-swiftdata/`

**Purpose**: Helps AI assistants work with SwiftGuion for importing screenplay files (Fountain, FDX, Highland) into SwiftData and exporting them back to screenplay formats.

**Capabilities**:
- Parse screenplay files with progress reporting
- Convert to SwiftData models with proper chapter indexing
- Export SwiftData back to screenplay formats
- Extract character, location, and outline analysis
- Build SwiftUI screenplay viewing apps
- Handle large files efficiently

**When to use**: Any time you're working with screenplay import/export, SwiftData integration, or building screenplay editing/production tools.

**Files**:
- `screenplay-swiftdata.md` - Comprehensive AI prompt with all patterns and workflows
- `examples.md` - Copy-paste code examples for common tasks
- `README.md` - Skill overview and usage guide

## How to Use These Skills

### With Claude Code

1. **Reference in conversation**: Point Claude to this directory when working on SwiftGuion tasks

```
"Help me import a screenplay file using the SwiftGuion library.
See the Skills/screenplay-swiftdata/ directory for guidance."
```

2. **Ask for specific workflows**:

```
"Use the screenplay import workflow from the skill to create
an import function with progress reporting."
```

3. **Request examples**:

```
"Show me the character analysis example from the SwiftGuion skill."
```

### With GitHub Copilot

1. **Open skill files** in your editor alongside your code
2. **Add comments** referencing the skill:

```swift
// Import screenplay using the pattern from Skills/screenplay-swiftdata/
// See examples.md for reference
func importScreenplay(from url: URL) async throws {
    // Copilot will suggest code based on the skill
}
```

3. **Use in workspace**:
- Keep skill files open in tabs
- Copilot will use them as context for suggestions

### With Cursor

1. **Add to context**: Use `@Skills/screenplay-swiftdata` in Cursor chat
2. **Reference specific sections**: Point Cursor to specific workflows or examples
3. **Use for code generation**: Ask Cursor to generate code following skill patterns

### With Other AI Assistants

1. **Copy relevant sections** from skill files
2. **Paste into your prompt** when asking for help
3. **Reference examples** for the AI to adapt
