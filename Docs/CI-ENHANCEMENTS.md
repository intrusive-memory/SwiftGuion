# CI/CD Enhancements

## Overview

The GitHub Actions CI workflow has been enhanced to collect, store, and display comprehensive test results and code coverage information.

## Features

### 1. Code Coverage Collection

- **Enabled Coverage**: Tests now run with `--enable-code-coverage` flag
- **Coverage Reports**: Generates both human-readable (`coverage-report.txt`) and LCOV format (`coverage.lcov`) reports
- **Coverage Display**: Shows coverage summary in GitHub Actions job summary

### 2. Test Results Tracking

- **Test Output Capture**: All test output is captured to `test-output.log`
- **Result Parsing**: Automatically extracts pass/fail counts from test output
- **Summary Display**: Shows test results in GitHub Actions job summary with emoji indicators (✅/❌)

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration

#### Job Summary

Each CI run now displays:
- **Test Results**: Pass/fail counts with visual indicators
- **Coverage Summary**: Overall coverage percentage with detailed breakdown
- **Collapsible Details**: Full coverage report available in expandable section

#### Artifacts

The following artifacts are uploaded and retained for 30 days:
- `test-output.log`: Complete test execution log
- `coverage-report.txt`: Human-readable coverage report
- `coverage.lcov`: LCOV-format coverage data (compatible with external services)
- `.github/coverage-badge.json`: Badge data for shields.io

### 4. Coverage Badge

A script generates a coverage badge JSON file that can be used with shields.io:
- **Location**: `.github/scripts/generate-coverage-badge.sh`
- **Badge Colors**:
  - 🟢 Green (`brightgreen`): ≥80% coverage
  - 🟡 Yellow: 60-79% coverage
  - 🟠 Orange: 40-59% coverage
  - 🔴 Red: <40% coverage

### 5. Coverage Threshold Check

- **Threshold**: 80% minimum coverage
- **Behavior**:
  - ✅ Passes silently if coverage meets or exceeds threshold
  - ⚠️  Issues a warning (but does not fail) if coverage is below threshold
  - Displays coverage percentage in logs

## Viewing Results

### In Pull Requests

1. Navigate to the "Checks" tab in your PR
2. Click on the "Run Tests" job
3. Scroll to the bottom to see the job summary with:
   - Test pass/fail counts
   - Overall coverage percentage
   - Expandable detailed coverage report

### In Actions Tab

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Click on any workflow run
3. View the job summary at the bottom of the run page
4. Download artifacts for detailed analysis

## Files Modified/Created

### Created Files
- `.github/scripts/generate-coverage-badge.sh`: Badge generation script
- `.github/CI-ENHANCEMENTS.md`: This documentation

### Modified Files
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml`: Enhanced with coverage and result collection

## Usage Example

The workflow runs automatically on:
- Pushes to `main` or `master` branches
- Pull requests targeting `main` or `master` branches

No manual intervention is required. All test results and coverage data are automatically collected and displayed.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
1. **Badge Display**: Add coverage badge to README.md using shields.io endpoint
2. **Codecov Integration**: Upload coverage to Codecov.io for trend analysis
3. **Test Result Publishing**: Use test result publishing actions for richer visualization
4. **Coverage Trends**: Track coverage changes over time
5. **PR Comments**: Automatically comment on PRs with coverage changes

## Coverage Badge Integration (Optional)

To display a coverage badge in your README.md, you can use shields.io with the generated badge JSON:

```markdown
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stovak/SwiftGuion/main/.github/coverage-badge.json)
```

Note: This requires committing the `coverage-badge.json` file to the repository, which would need a separate workflow step with write permissions.
