# PITCH NOTES

## **_LOGLINE_**

Set in modern Palm Springs, semi-retired photojournalist Mitch Sawyer and his husband Billy Charles become embroiled in a mystery when billionaire Clive WYNANT’s assistant is murdered and the whole Wynant family is suspect.

## **_GENRES_**

Mystery, LGBT, PALM SPRINGS, Noir, Comedy

## **_THE BIG QUESTION_**

Why do human beings believe people we know to be lying to us? 

Bill Clinton told us he didn’t have sex with “that woman”. OJ told us he didn’t kill his wife. Trump told us the virus would just “go away” and that he won an election he didn’t win. 

W.C. Fields is credited with saying “There’s a sucker born every minute.” It’s hard to argue with that given that every day people are conned out of their money by charisma and persuasion and we buy it: Hook line and sinker. 

## **_SHORT PITCH_**

I’ve tried to write this series multiple times with fits and starts. But when I stumbled onto this Mitch and Billy storyline, I knew I had what had previously alluded me: A really fun murder mystery in the spirit of movies like “The Thin Man” and TV series like “Heart to Heart” and “Moonlighting”.

## **_SETTING_**

Enter the world of modern Palm Springs. The hippy-culture of the 60’s and California weed legalization of the 90’s has given way to a city that is not ashamed of enjoying the use of recreational drugs or trying polyamorous sex. In this world, everything about modern American monoculture is boring and bland next to the multicolor, poly-gendered and un-gendered “QUEER” culture. 

The story is an meditation on why humans trust people, despite reasonable doubt of their trustworthiness. Why do we believe “The lies of handsome men”?

Come visit the world of Mr & Mr Charles.

She is **MIMI WYNANT JYORGANSEN** (40-50’s, Kardashian-esque, Bo+Tee athleisure shows off the curves she’s worked hard to achieve).

She holds the empty purse out, inspecting the interior tag--Pffffft. A knockoff--figures--tossing it aside. 

She stuffs the money in the Birkin slung over her shoulder that is, most assuredly, not a knockoff, along with the keys she used to open the front door.

SPEW!

Ulna.

MITCH
Ulna! U-L-N-A...

Mitch gives Donnie a look over the reading glasses, then continues with his crossword.

DONNIE
I’m DONNIE WYNANT. You probably don’t remember me, but you ought to remember my father, /Clive WYNANT--

MITCH ^
/Oh, yeaaaaahhhhhh--I remember you, but you were only a kid of eleven or twelve then, weren’t you?

A bank of fog rolls over Jacinto in the background.

DONNIE
That was about ten years ago. 

MITCH downs the last of his current martini.

MITCH
(bitterly)
Weeelllll, Time flies when you drink your way through a presidency and a pandemic. How is your father?

DONNIE
I was going to ask you. Momma divorced him and we never hear from him, except when someone new sues him for child support, and that only happens every couple of years. Do you ever see him?

MITCH
(to the bartender)
Can I get another a gin martini, wet and dirty with three olives and...?
(asking Donnie)

MITCH goes back to his crossword with an eye-roll wanting to be left alone, as Donnie seems determined to talk to him.

I’ve been back east for a few years.

INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUES

#### SHOT: MIMI in apartment living room

INT. HUNTERS - CONTINUES FROM BEFORE

### TWO SHOT: MITCH & DONNIE

MITCH, still buried in his crossword:

MITCH
(more to himself)
See Who?

DONNIE
Momma would raise hell if she found out, but still.

MITCH
See who?

DONNIE
My father. It’s been since last October--

MITCH
What’s stopping you? 
(to BARTENDER)
A four letter word for “Like Greek Statues”? Ends in “E”.

DONNIE
I think he moved again without telling us. He used to do that and then momma would have one of her “episodes.”

MITCH
He bought that social network a few years back. Why don’t you ask them where he is? They could probably track his company phone.

DONNIE
The last location they have on him is that old country club, but I’ve been there and it’s all boarded up.

Wonder where the finale of the show’s going to be?

MITCH
Try his lawyer. 

DONNIE
Do you remember his name?

BARTENDER
Nude
(beat)
Like greek statues... 

MITCH
NUDE!
(agreeing, writing)
Used to be a guy named Mac something or the other... McCowley--that’s it. Herbert McCowley. He was in the Bradbury building.

Donnie whips out his phone and types--puts the phone to his ear, walking away.

BILLY (O.C.)
She’s had quite an afternoon.

REFRAME TO:

### SHOT: BILLY making an entrance

At the other end of Freeway’s leash, his owner makes an entrance... 


>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::<
>🚨     _**BILLY CHARLES**_     🚨<
>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::<


Male, 40’s... exudes an elegance and disregard for things, that betrays the fact that he was born into money--enters wearing something **_BILLY PORTER-ESQUE, TRAIN-STOPPINGLY FASHIONABLE_** carrying shopping bags.

BILLY
She knocked over a rack of toys at Mr. Turk’s, Scared a fat woman silly licking her leg at the Shag Store and had a torrid thirty-second tryst with a cocker spaniel. 

Billy’s messenger bag and Mitch’s vest matches the color of the dog’s coat: That is not an accident.

BILLY
(coquette, amused)
Speaking of trysts, Who’s your little friend?
(meaning Donnie)

MITCH points to his drink in sight of the bartender, ordering one for BILLY.

MITCH
You don’t want to know. Did you find an outfit for the fundraiser?

BILLY
You being mysterious always makes me suspicious. There are candidate outfits. One has not emerged as being a favorite, just yet.

MITCH is completely engrossed in the crossword.

MITCH
Well, that’s progress--

Bartender arrives with drinks.

BARTENDER
Two Gin martinis, wet and dirty with extra olives.

Before they drink, they toast.

BILLY
(toasting)
May you die in a way that brings scandal to

BILLY
--everyone you know.

MITCH^
--everyone you know.



MITCH
I’ll drink to that.
(clinks glasses)

DONNIE arrives back at the bar.

DONNIE
I found him.

MITCH
Your father?

DONNIE
The lawyer. He’s still in the Bradbury building right there on Market.

MITCH
Donnie, I’d like you to meet my husband, William Jefferson Charles the Third. BILLY, this is Donnie WYNANT. I did a story on his father back when little Donnie was a baby-gay-in-pigtails and poodle skirts.

DONNIE
I was fascinated by MITCH--

BILLY
(droll sarcasm)
Well, we all are, really. 
(then)
Say, Donnie, when were you born? What day and month?

They talk “around” MITCH whose nose is still in his crossword.

DONNIE
August thirtieth, why do you ask?

BILLY
Virgo, the virgin. How simply delightful. Explains those stars in your eyes.

Billy is annoyed that Mitch won’t look up from his crossword and join the conversation.

DONNIE
It’s not everyday you meet a world famous investigative journalist. I used to follow him around and demand he tell me about his experiences.

BILLY
Be warned: He’s not a journalist anymore so he doesn’t have to submit those stories he tells to a fact-checker.

DONNIE
How does that old song go... “I believe the lies of handsome men”?

MITCH
(to the bartender)
Fourteen down: a nine letter phrase for “Reciprocal Prostitute”?

Billy takes the crossword away from MITCH.

BILLY
(to Donnie)
Did he love puzzles as much back then? These days, Once he starts one, he can’t stop until he finishes. Not even if simple courtesy means he should put it down and make polite conversation with those around him--

MITCH
--Sorry, I--

DONNIE
--Speaking of polite, I’ve been ignoring my friends long enough. I need to get back.

BILLY
Oh, no worries, Max will be here any minute with the car.

MITCH fumbles, produces a business card.

MITCH
Here. Take my card and keep in touch.

DONNIE
(taking the card)
Here’s to family reunions, Mr. & Mr. Charles.

Lifting drinks...

MITCH
Cheers.

BILLY ^
Cheers.

Hello, I’d like to report a murder. It looks like whoever-it-was robbed the place too.

BILLY (PRELAP)
I think we should call to inform the FAA.

INT. HUNTERS - CONTINUES FROM BEFORE

### SHOT: BILLY and MITCH on a couch in the bar

MITCH
Inform them of what exactly?

BILLY
Pilots navigating over this area of the Coachella Valley, may experience wind sheer from the way that young boy was batting his eyelashes at you.

MITCH
You are being completely ridiculous.

BILLY
So he’s not your ‘type’?

MITCH
No, dear, only you. 

BILLY
(enjoying his angst at this line of questioning)
Then how about that red-head you wandered off with at the Quinn’s last night?

MITCH
Don’t be silly. He just wanted to show me some of his camera equipment.

BILLY
(innocently)
And did you find his equipment... adequate to your needs?

REFRAME TO:

### SHOT: In the style of Mid-Century Modern illustration, leaning heavily into retro futurism, show a close-up of two men sitting side by side at a stylish Palm Springs bar, each holding a martini. The man on the left wears a teal short-sleeve button-up shirt and a bright pink messenger bag across his torso, and his haircut is a swept-back, classic side part. The man on the right, in a patterned short-sleeve shirt over a blue tee and white shorts. He has a classic hair style with widows peak and a few streaks of grey and wears a pair of tortoiseshell ray-ban glasses. The scene is relaxed, playful, and sunlit, with geometric shapes, palm trees, and a starburst lens flare in the window behind them. No table between them, and the mood is pure 1960s Palm Springs optimism.

Just outside the door, a ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM pulls into view, waits, with MAX (50’s, deliberately ambiguous gender & ethnicity) at the wheel.

MITCH
Oh, look! There’s Max.

Billy gives MITCH his signature Raised Eyebrow Lewk™. MITCH picks up Billy’s Shopping bags, but Billy stops him, handing back the crossword.

BILLY
Fourteen down, nine letters, starts with “Q”: A “reciprocal prostitute” is a “Quid Pro Ho.”

Billy heads toward the car.

Parting shot of the boys getting in the rolls and it driving away.

MITCH

One woman actually clutches her purse closer, as if Billy would grab it and run away, should the valuables not be secured.

BILLY

### BAR ENTRANCE: OLIVIA HUTCHINSON-CHARLES

Billy’s Mom, OLIVIA HUTCHINSON-CHARLES, makes an entrance with all the vampy-adoration Billy had in the bar. (wonder where he learned it?)

OLIVIA greets and Hollywood-kisses a few “friends” sitting at the other tables before joining Billy, kissing him gently on the cheek.

### TWO-SHOT: BILLY & OLIVIA at a table

OLIVIA
Hello, William. I appreciate you meeting me for brunch.

The moment she sits, a waiter drops off an Old Fashioned in an up-glass for her without being asked.

BILLY
I appreciate you meeting me, as well. I know what a risk it can be... venturing into the sunlight when you’re a vampire.

OLIVIA
Now, now. Mustn’t be catty around the white people.

BILLY
Oh, I wouldn’t dream of tarnishing their little pet.

OLIVIA
Speaking of pets, how is that stray white boy you’re letting sleep with you? I saw him over there, with the cast of Big Little Lies Silicon Valley, drooling like cats in heat.

BILLY
He sleeps with me because we’re married, mother, and he’s celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first book being published. 

OLIVIA
Twenty-five years? You do you realize when he was writing that book, you were sperm?

BILLY
Don’t be vulgar, mother. Can you just get to the point? You could have gotten any author to do that book club meeting. Why did you drag us out here, into the hills of Caucasia?

OLIVIA
Well, I was going to wait until after we eat, but now’s as good of a time as any: I have an opportunity for you.

BILLY
(eyeroll)
Like when Aunt Lilly tried to get us to sell Amway?

OLIVIA
Don’t be morose, dear. This is the premiere social event of the season. We always hold it every year on the Sunday after easter here at the club and--

BILLY
Wait so, you want me to throw this social event for you?

BILLY
I do, but why would you
/want me--Wait, Didn’t you throw this event
/last year?
And didn’t it bomb last year?
/No it did. 
/It bombed.
Like Pearl Harbor
(makes bomb noises)

OLIVIA ^
 
/You do have an event management company, do you not?
/As I told you we hold the event every year.
/Don’t be silly. We raised more than-
/Well, that’s a massive oversimpli--

OLIVIA
*I* don’t want you to do it. *THEY* do.

BILLY
“They” who?

OLIVIA
The Board of the Charity. Some old white guys.

BILLY
Old white guys want me to throw them a party?

OLIVIA
No one was more amazed than I.

BILLY
What happens if I don’t?

OLIVIA
Then the club will find someone else to do it. I’ll tell them you’re unavailable. But you should really consider--

BILLY
Of all of the homosexual party planners in the Bay Area, Why do they want me?

OLIVIA
Apparently you did one of their granddaughters’ birthday parties and it went viral and made her a star on social media. 

Billy thinks about it. Olivia sips giving an innocent side-eye:

OLIVIA
You could do
(beat)
...a cabaret number.

A mother knows her son’s kryptonite.

BILLY
(incensed)
If you think for a second appealing to my vanity by offering to let me sing on stage is going to make me reconsider--

## PUSH IN on McCowley 

Flipping pages as he watches Billy and His mom.

MITCH slips up behind him unnoticed.

Billy and I found each other during some really dark times for both of us. I’d just lost my husband and he’d lost his sister. We both got lucky.
(smiling)
So what’s going on with you these days?

### TWO SHOT: MITCH and MCCOWLEY with BILLY and HIS MOM in the background

MCCOWLEY
Still working for WYNANT--The old man, not the ex-wife and kids.

MITCH
Oy, what a piece of work that family is.

MCCOWLEY
You’re telling me. Mimi’s tried a couple of times to get him committed to an institution and get a hold of his money, but I’ve managed to stave that off a little longer.

MITCH
How’d you manage that?

MCCOWLEY
By the simple fact that I don’t know where he is. 

CONCEIRGE (PRELAP)
I’m sorry, that day is not available.

PRELAP: Olivia hits a sour chord on the piano.

INT. AT THE PIANO BAR - CONTINUOUS

### SHOT: Billy and Olivia at the Piano. CONCIERGE standing nearby

The CONCIERGE stands with an appointment book in his hand, flipping through the book.

BILLY
What do you mean that day is not available?

CONCEIRGE
What I mean is that if you come here on that day, an event that is not your event will be taking place.

OLIVIA
Julio always reserves us that day.

CONCEIRGE
Julio no longer works for the club.

OLIVIA
How DARE you fire Julio. If you’ve mistreated that sweet old man, I Will--

CONCEIRGE
--He no longer works for us because he’s dead.

BILLY
Dead?

OLIVIA ^
He’s what!?--What do you mean dead?

CONCEIRGE
What part of “dead” was unclear to you?

OLIVIA
He can’t be dead. He reserves us the same day every year.

CONCEIRGE
Well he didn’t this year. On account of him no longer employed here, and, you know, dead.

OLIVIA
Can the event that day be moved?

The Concierge closes the appointment book.

CONCEIRGE
I wouldn’t know.

BILLY
Well, what event stole our day?

CONCEIRGE
Sir, it really does no good--

BILLY

What event is being held on our day?

MCCOWLEY
I get emails from WYNANT about every six months checking on things. Or at least until he text’d me driving over here.

MITCH
That seems... coincidental.

MCCOWLEY
Right? I thought I’d stop by because I was hoping you’d help me understand what the old shrew is after.

MITCH
Mimi, Who knows. Does she have to be up to something?

MCCOWLEY
She usually is. And if there’s shenanigans going on, you’re the one usually in the know.

### SHOT: Birkin bag on MIMI’s arm.

Donnie comes out of a nearby broom closet tucking in his shirt, zipping up his pants, seeing Billy, quickly closes the door labeled “Janitorial”. 

Billy doesn’t see the janitorial closet exit, but notices Donnie when he approaches.

BILLY
Donnie! Nice to see you again, sweetie. What are you doing here?

### THREE SHOT: Donnie standing, BILLY & OLIVIA at the piano

DONNIE
I’m here all the time. When my parents got divorced, momma fought to get custody of the club membership and had to take full custody of me as part of the deal. They’ve been members for years. I’ve never see you here before.

### LONG SHOT: Piano w/Billy & Olivia + Donnie standing

While they speak, OLDER GENTLEMAN IN A SUIT exits the JANITORIAL door Donnie just left, spits into a plant, walks off.

Donnie expertly directs Billy’s attention in a different direction.

BILLY
Well, My parents are members and we have our foundation dinner here every year. At least we did.

### THREE SHOT: Donnie standing, BILLY & OLIVIA at the piano

OLIVIA
I can’t believe It--The fundraiser--(starting to hyper-ventilate) We’re not going to be able to raise--

BILLY
Take a Xanax and calm down mother.  I’ll get the driver to get you home and just leave it with me.

### TWO SHOT: MITCH AND MCCOWLEY

MITCH
A few years after Clark and I got married, his father died and left us a pile of money including a big chunk of Apple and Disney. So when he died and the fourth website in a row laid me off, I just decided to live off the investments and whatever money I could make from the books. After Billy and I got together, well his family has money and a foundation to give it away and that keeps him busy and us in plenty of recreational drugs. 

MCCOWLEY
Nice work if you can get it.

MITCH
I’ve been extraordinarily lucky. I own that. And I’ve tilted my share of windmills and I have no desire for any more battles I know I can’t win. Anyway, I wouldn’t be investigating Mimi WYNANT--Jyorgansen--or whatever name she’s going by these days. 

MIMI (PRELAP)

I’m sorry, I thought you were someone else.

MIMI
I’m ready to leave. Please take me home.

### FOUR SHOT: DONNIE & MIMI standing, BILLY & OLIVIA at the piano

OLIVIA
(thinly veiled disgust)
Mimi! So good to see you back from your stay at that facility.

MIMI
(false affection)
Oh, Olivia. Every time I see you it makes me more and more glad the club added that diversity program.

BILLY
(under his breath)
Oh, no she didn’t...

OLIVIA
(TO BILLY)
I’m a bit peckish, can we order the club’s charcuterie tray with some extra crackers--No, wait, we already have plenty of crackers, tell them just the meat and cheese--

MIMI
I see the club asked you to host the gala again. I would have thought after last year’s disaster--

BILLY
I’ll be managing the preparations.

MIMI
And who exactly are you?

Mimi holds up a hand:

MIMI
No, wait--I don’t really care and I’m not meeting any new people right now.

### LONG SHOT: MIMI & DONNIE exit

EXT. POOL/PATIO AREA - CONTINUES FROM BEFORE

### LONG SHOT: MITCH & MCCOWLEY

MITCH
WYNANT came clean about her mental issues up front. I interviewed him and while I was there at the house, she had an “episode”. I decided it wasn’t relevant to the story I was writing.

### MASTER TWO-SHOT: MITCH & MCCOWLEY

MCCOWLEY
So What story are you working on now?

MITCH
I’m not working on a story.

MCCOWLEY
Really? Because it kinda seems like--

MITCH: Deep hit from Mitch’s vape.

MITCH
Trust me. I’m not working on anything other than self medication.
(exhaling smoke)

A Phone Vibrates.

MITCH
Just write them a check and you probably won’t hear the name “WYNANT” again for a couple of years.

McCowley looks at his phone and makes an “OH, REALLY?” Face to MITCH showing him the phone’s screen.

# CHAPTER 3: THE FAT MAN

SUPER: CHAPTER 3 - INTERVIEW WITH THE FAT MAN

“LA DOLCE VITA” style Paparazzi montage (Various Locations) set to something upbeat like “MONEY-GRABBER” by Fitz and the Tantrums:

- EXT. MIMI’S HOUSE: Middle of the night, police at , Mimi in a bathrobe but still with her Birkin bag in place on the shoulder... Bulbs flash, photos snap

- EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT: MIMI and her HUSBAND, KRISTOBAL JYORGENSEN (40’s, him-bo)--Both wearing dark glasses--are seen leaving the police station, Berkin bag in place and at attention... Bulbs flash, photos snap

- EXT. THE BEACH - DAY: Photos of MIMI and her HUSBAND, KRISTOBAL on the beach: Still has the Berkin bag...  Bulbs flash, photos snap

- EXT. HOUSE IN RICHMOND DISTRICT - DAY: Mimi (+bag) lets the cops into the boarded-up victorian-style house.

- INT. HOUSE IN RICHMOND DISTRICT - ENTRY: The chandelier projects the shape of the WYNANTech logo on the ceiling. 

- .HALLWAY: Andy Warhol treatment of the WYNANTech logo down the side of one wall

- .HALLWAY: Carpet in the hallway has the WYNANTech logo in a subtle pattern.

- .STUDY: Lighter and darker wood on the floor and the pattern isn’t immediately recognizable.

- .ENTRY: The cops spread out, but it’s clear nobody’s been there for a while: Dust on the furniture. Nothing in the fridge or pantry.

- .ENTRY: Seen from above, the lighter/darker wood combination makes the shape of the WYNANTTech Logo on the floor of the study.

- EXT. HOUSE IN RICHMOND DISTRICT - DAY: Ultimately the police find nothing at the house. 

- EXT. HOUSE IN RICHMOND DISTRICT - DAY: Mimi locks up the house after the last cop leaves.

EXT. THE MARIN MANS - MAGIC HOUR

Billy and Grant recline on the patio watching the sun go down.

Max passes by, removing empty martini glasses and replacing them with full ones...

BILLY
Did you know her...?

MITCH
Julia? Yes.

BILLY
What was she like?

MITCH
She was sharp. And pretty. She had a lot of sense and a lot of nerve. She kept WYNANT’s crazier rants out of the press. She seemed to play him like a piano, which was why the Investment Firm hired her in the first place.

BILLY
Were they sleeping together?

MITCH covers a burp with his hand.

MITCH
Please don’t make me think about straight people having sex. You know how it makes me dyspeptic.

BILLY
I’m sorry. You want to watch videos of shirtless guys doing household chores?

MITCH
If I ever say “no” to that question, you will know that someone has a gun to my head.

Billy uses a remote to turn on a nearby tv, muting the sound.

On the screen, a good looking SHIRTLESS VIDEO TV HUNK mops the floor. Freeway jumps up and cuddles with them.

MITCH
Besides, You know I have difficulty paying attention when straight people talk about their relationships.

BILLY
What did he look like?

MITCH
WYNANT? When I knew him, he walked with a cane.

INT. WYNANT HOUSE - THE RICHMOND DISTRICT - FLASHBACK

.THIRD FLOOR BEDROOM

LITTLE DONNIE WYNANT (10, baby gay in-training, bow-tie, dress shirt and polyester grr-animals pants) runs down the stairs of the house the police just searched, but now it’s new and clean and occupied by all the WYNANTs.

.SECOND FLOOR MASTER SUITE

Donnie runs past YOUNGER MIMI taking pills in the bedroom. 

Then down the stairs to the 

.FIRST FLOOR

--into the door of the study where a HULKING FIGURE PACES.

.THE STUDY

WYNANT casts a long shadow across the center of the study who’s floor at this time contains no logo.

**SINGLE COLORED SHINY HARDWOOD FLOORS** squeak underneath the weight of CLIVE WYNANT (50’s-M, fat, tall, should-length, white hair) who limps around his study, pacing, checking his watch, leaning heavily on a cane.

WYNANT
Julia?

Bespectacled WYNANT takes off his glasses and polishes them with a cloth from his pocket.

WYNANT
How much longer is he going to be?

Putting back on his glasses, he checks his watch against the clock on the wall. Underneath the clock, a small plaque above the mantle reads “The hour is later than you think.”

JULIA (O.S.)
I can ask.

JULIA WOLFE (30’s, an air of quiet competence surrounds her) enters, giving Little Donnie’s hair a tousle on the way in.

WYNANT
Remind me to have these floorboards replaced. There’s a couple of loose ones. He’s taking forever. 

JULIA
He’s allowed to.

WYNANT
Says who?

JULIA
(adjusting his tie)
His Pulitzer Prize.

WYNANT
So because he won some fancy award he gets special treatment?

JULIA
He gets special treatment because when he speaks a lot of really important people listen. And you’d do well to remember that.

WYNANT
You think he’ll care about what’s happening to my family?

JULIA
He’s not going to care about anything if you’re an ass.

PRODUCER appears in the doorway wearing a head-mic and holding a clipboard.

PRODUCER
Mr. Sawyer is ready for you, Mr. WYNANT.

.IN THE LIVING ROOM

The living room has been cleared of furniture and portable studio lights illuminate two chairs: One where MITCH sits and an empty one for WYNANT.

MITCH
I really want to thank you for doing this interview.

WYNANT limps across the room, leaning heavily on a cane, and eases into the chair as a SOUND GUY helps him with a microphone pinned to his clothes.

WYNANT
It wasn’t my idea. I--

MITCH stops him with a hand.

MITCH
I’m going to remind you, whenever you’re in the room with me you’re on the record and the cameras are recording. I’m not going to trick you and try and get you to say something off the record, because EVERYTHING is on the record. Period. No exceptions.

MITCH notices LITTLE DONNIE WYNANT, standing just outside the room, peeking in the door.

WYNANT
I understand. What I was going to say is that I wouldn’t have agreed to this if ROSEWATER hadn’t threatened my family.

BILLY (O.S.)
Rosewater?

INT. THE MARIN MANS - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUES FROM BEFORE

SHIRTLESS VIDEO TV HUNK is squeezing out the mop careful to show both his pecs and arm muscles.

MITCH
One of WYNANT’s business partners--something or the other Rosewater--accused him of stealing an invention. The interview is on YouTube somewhere.

BILLY
Did he do it?

SHIRTLESS VIDEO TV HUNK, having finished the floor, turns his attention to the carpet but must bend WAAAAAAYYYYYY over, to plug in the vacuum.

MITCH
I honestly don’t know.

Mitch starts massaging Billy’s back.

BILLY
Don’t you ever think you’d like to  write once in a while? Maybe freelance... Start your own blog or something.

MITCH
I’m not starting a true crime podcast, if that’s what you’re getting at. Besides,

MITCH
I’m not working on anything 

BILLY^
(mimicking him)
I’m not working on anything but self-medication.

BILLY
Keep tellin’ yourself that enough times: Someday you actually may believe it. Swap.

They swap and Billy takes over rubbing MITCH’s back.

BILLY
I know how you are with puzzles: You can’t put them down until you’ve got them figured out.

MITCH
There’s nothing to figure out here. WYNANT killed her and the police will catch him without my help. That’s not the life I want for myself anymore. Besides, I’m trying to make sure you don’t lose any of the money I married you for.

That makes Billy smile. They kiss.

BILLY
Speaking of getting hustled, I ran into Donnie this afternoon, and--

MITCH
No.

BILLY
You didn’t even hear what I had to say.

MITCH
I didn’t need to. I’ve seen that look in your eyes many times. You’re about to adopt a household pet.

BILLY
But--

MITCH
Donnie cannot stay with us. There’s nothing we can do to help him. We are not taking in every little stray kitten that follows us home.

The doorbell rings. Donnie’s voice can be heard SINGING.

BILLY
Would you like to let in the cat or shall I?

MITCH
Can’t we just set an open tuna can outside the door and hope for the best?

EXT. THE MARIN MANS - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Outside, a very drunk Donnie sings Ariana Grande in falsetto:

DONNIE
~ Right now I’m in a state of mind
~ I want to be in like all the time…
~ Ain’t got no tears left to cry…

MITCH opens the door. Donnie’s in the shadows.

MITCH
Come on in, Ariana Pequeña. BILLY’s making coffee.

Donnie rushes to MITCH, embracing him. MITCH blanches at his breath.

DONNIE
(slurring his speech)
Oh, MITCH, I’m so glad it’s you.

MITCH hands Donnie off to BILLY.

BILLY
Let’s get you some water--

Now that Donnie is in the light, it looks like someone has punched him in the eye.

MITCH
What happened to you?

DONNIE
(embarrassed)
I ran into the door. Hey, look what I got.

Donnie pulls out a gun, waving it wildly. Mitch and Billy duck and cover.

MITCH
Oh, for f--let me have that.

Mitch takes the gun away from him.

MITCH
What’s the matter with you? Are you trying to kill us? Where’d you get that?

DONNIE
A friend in the tenderloin.

There’s that Eyebrow Lewk™ from Billy again.

BILLY
With the next most obvious question being “Why”?

DONNIE
I’m afraid of my-(hiccup) My-(hiccup) My Mom. It’s not loaded. I’m just gonna make her behave.

MITCH
And you’re going to point a GUN at your mother? 

DONNIE
Relax. I would have just threatened her with it. Just to keep her from becoming violent.

MITCH
When you point a gun, you should be prepared to use it. You can’t go waving them around like--

Donnie begins to sob against Billy.

BILLY
Oh, to be young, gay and dramatic again.

Mitch places the gun in a cabinet drawer then crosses to make a drink while BILLY escorts Donnie off to a guest room.

MITCH
Two out of three ain’t bad.

On his way out, Billy: raspberry.

MIMI (prelap)
I think it was... raining.

EXT. JULIA WOLFE’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK

MIMI WYNANT-JYORGANSEN sits in her Volvo SUV watching the rain come down.

INT. THE MARIN MANS - DINING ROOM - DAY

MIMI and her husband, KRISTOBAL (holding on to 39 with both hands) and Donnie sit sipping martinis with both Mr. Charles’s around a table having brunch.

MIMI
It felt like it was raining.

“Living Ken-doll” KRISTOBAL, nods in agreement: Trophy husbands only speak when spoken-to directly.

MITCH
What does that even mean?

Donnie sits sipping a cocktail, symbolically “between” the two couples.

EXT. JULIA WOLFE’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK

Mimi gets out of the car and crosses the small parking area to the front door of a townhome.

MIMI (V.O.)
When I knocked, the door swung open.

Mimi knocks once, adjusts the Birkin bag as the door opens for her with an exaggerated horror-movie creak. Mimi clutches a non-existent string of pearls, then enters the townhome.

MIMI (V.O.)
The place has been **RAM**-sacked.

MITCH (O.S.)
It’s pronounced “**RAN**sacked”.

BILLY (O.S.)
SHHHHH

Tables are turned over and couch cushions sliced. 

MIMI (V.O.)
Someone was looking for something. I made my way through the house...

Mimi wanders through the house, then goes upstairs.

MITCH (V.O.)
Technically, doesn’t that mean you were looking for something as well?

Mimi looks in multiple rooms until she trips over something and falls... 

...COMING FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE MURDERED CORPSE OF JULIA WOLFE.

OVERLY DRAMATIC TRACK-AND-ZOOM AS MIMI SCREAMS LOUDLY.

INT. THE MARIN MANS - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is riveted--eyes on Mimi.

MIMI
I was scared to death. I’m honestly surprised I’m here to tell the tale.

MITCH downs the rest of his drink. Max appears with a refill. MITCH mouths “I love you” in return. There’s that Eyebrow Lewk™  from Billy again.

MIMI
MITCH, I do want to thank you for your hospitality in taking care of my Donnie last night.

DONNIE
I’m not you’re anything--

BILLY
(hand on Donnie’s leg)
It was no trouble, really.

Donnie is contempt, personified; MITCH blows vape smoke, bored.

MIMI
I was going to ask, do YOU have any idea where that ex-husband of mine has run off to?

Phrased as a question, but feels like a threat.

MIMI
It really is sad when the mentally ill don’t get the help they need--

DONNIE
(staring at his mother)
--And sad sometimes when they do--

MIMI
(ignoring Donnie)
--It’s no wonder the police first thought he had something to do with it.

KRISTOBAL nods and his distinctive facial hair bounces with his nod: Someone really should do something.

MITCH
What do they think now?

MIMI
Haven’t you--? I mean, it’s all over social media.

MITCH
Social media interferes with my drinking time.

MIMI
His name is VINETTI. That’s who killed him. He’s a drug dealer!

... as if incontrovertible proof of malevolence.

MITCH
(perking up)
Really? Do you have any way to contact him? Perhaps a discreet email address?

BILLY
I wonder if he’s got any of those eye drops they used in The Batman movie. I’ve been meaning to try those.

MITCH
Pink cocaine is very in vogue right now. I know several people currently in rehab for it.

MIMI
No, it’s true. There was a news segment that I watched several minutes of. They were lovers and he killed her in a fit of jealous rage. 

KRISTOBAL
It certainly wasn’t anyone else for any other reason.

Mimi shuts him up with a look. MITCH downs the rest of his drink. Max goes to refill, but BILLY cautions him with a slight “no” gesture.

MIMI
I just hope we can find Clive and get him the help he needs. McCowley won’t help me at all. He says he doesn’t know where he is, But that’s ridiculous. 

Instead of replacing his drink, Max drops a charcuterie board for the table and makes a point handing MITCH a plate with some cheese and crackers on it.

MIMI
He has Powers-of-Attorney for Clive and all the businesses. There’s no way he doesn’t know where he is. 

MITCH stands and reaches for the cocktail shaker on the buffet to pour himself another drink.

MAX
I would remind you that you have an event this afternoon, sir.
(under his breath)
One for which you might want to be sober.

MITCH
No such event exists. Anywhere. At any hour of the day or night.

MIMI
Well, we’ll be running off soon. Aunt Ida is expecting us with--

BILLY
Nonsense. You should stay and join our little get-together we’re throwing this afternoon.

MITCH, now standing behind Mimi, flashes BILLY an alarmed look, shaking his head “no”.

MIMI
Oh, no, MITCH doesn’t want us hanging around--

MITCH
(busted)
Don’t be silly. Of course there’s room for a few more.

Mimi looks first to Donnie then to her husband, decides.

MIMI
Well, in that case...Sure. We’d love to join you.

MITCH snatches the cocktail shaker from Max’s hands, sits back down, pouring then sipping.

MITCH
Wonderful. And the nudity is completely optional.

EXT. THE MARIN MANS - BY THE POOL - LATE DAY

The sun sets behind two groups of two naked MALE PARTY GOERS on each other’s shoulders wrestling in the pool. 

MIMI (O.S.)
It’s not about me, you know.

One group goes over with a big splash and OTHER MALE PARTY-GOERS reclining in the pool chairs clap in appreciation.

MITCH (O.S.)
What’s not “about you”?

Kristobal Jyorgansen is PLAYING BACKGAMMON with ANOTHER NAKED MALE PARTYGOER and passes a joint to him.

MIMI (O.S.)
Finding Clive. It’s not about me. It’s about the children.

Donnie is making eyes at ANOTHER NAKED MALE PARTYGOER 2 and is VERY INTERESTED in whatever they’re talking about.

MITCH (O.S.)
Your children are twenty years old. They can take care of themselves.

MITCH makes drinks for TWO MORE MALE GUESTS as Mimi sits at a nearby table alone in a terrycloth robe, sipping--her shapely figure ignored by the men at the party.

MIMI
But that’s just it: They can’t. We didn’t prepare them for a world where they don’t have money. 

Billy makes an entrance in a new swimsuit/kimono/sunglasses combo that has his adoring public clapping politely. 

MIMI
(through drunk tears)
They’re both going to be living under the interstate, cooking a can of beans over an open fire with the rest of the hobos.

MITCH brings Mimi a fresh drink and sits with her watching Billy work the patio.

MITCH
Well, first of all, we don’t live in a depression-era silent film--

BILLY
(zooming by while working the patio)
And second, white men have a special sort of magic. It makes them immune to failure. 

MITCH
That's fair. I have fucked up. Like **A LOT**.

MIMI
Look, I just want you to know it wasn’t me that took your mom’s day .

BILLY
That took...??

MIMI
Janice Van Buren has had it out for her ever since your mom upstaged her at the talent show a few years back so she deliberately planned an event on your mom’s day and then invited all the club members to her event so they wouldn’t go to your mom’s.

BILLY
I see.

Donnie is standing on a surf board with another man behind him and several watching fans, giving a “surfing” lesson.

BILLY
Somehow I think he will be fine.

MIMI
Oh, you’re just saying that-- 
(to MITCH)
You could find him.

MITCH
Find who?

MIMI
Clive.

MITCH
The police are going to find him any day.

MIMI
(feeling the booze)
No they won’t. Ten years from now we’ll all be interviewed for a reboot of “UNSOLVED MYSTERIES” and I won’t have the money to have botox the week before. I’ll just be the sad ex-wife who’s unattractive and living in a condominium in one of the cheaper red states.

It’s unclear as to whether Billy is more disturbed at the idea of living in a red state or a condominium.

MITCH
Just calm down Mimi. Nobody’s moving to any red states.

MIMI
You could find him, MITCH.

MITCH
Oh, no. I don’t--

MIMI
You could use your connections. Oh, please, MITCH. Will you help me? You’re my only hope. We used to be friends.

MITCH
(shaking his head “no”)
For Christ’s Sake. There’s a thousand amateur detectives working on this case and no less than three podcasts. You can’t hide these days like you used to be able to. Someone will find out something. It’s only a matter of time.

The same group of men just won another pool wrestling match. They flex their arms in a show of strength.

MIMI
You think so?

MITCH
Yes, And we still are friends.
(walking away, under breath)
Friends who see each other very infrequently.
(Drains glass)

Across the party, ONE OF THE SECOND TIER GAYS is posting to Instagram...

PHONE SCREEN: a photo of MITCH and Billy consoling Mimi with the caption “Can MITCH Sawyer get to the bottom of this?”.

Below the caption: the location data for the post... A spinning progress bar stops on “Sausalito, CA.”

INT. THE MARIN MANS - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

ECU: MITCH sleeping.  Billy’s hand shakes MITCH slightly attempting, unsuccessfully to wake him up. Billy’s hand shakes MITCH harder and MITCH mumbles a curse.

BILLY
(whispers gently)
There’s a man with a gun in our bedroom.

MITCH’s eyes are wide open and a gun trigger cocks.

# CHAPTER 4: THE CANNABIS ENTREPRENEUR

SUPER: CHAPTER 4: THE CANNABIS ENTREPRENEUR

A gun trigger cocks.

VINETTI (PRELAP)
I need ya to tell them.

INT. THE MARIN MANS - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

MITCH’s eyes are wide open.

MITCH slides into a defensive position facing VINCENT VINETTI (30’s, wearing all-black) holding a gun but pointing it at nothing in particular.

MITCH
You need me to tell who, what?

Dark circles under VINETTI’s eyes are exaggerated by the moon shining through the skylight above.

VINETTI
The police. I didn’t do it.

MITCH
What didn’t you--is there any way we can have this conversation some other--

VINETTI
Partman tells me you used to be okay--

MITCH
--Myron Partman?! How’s he doing? I interviewed him a few years back in a San Quinton series for MSNBC--

VINETTI
He’s alright. But he don’t like it when people call him Myron. He’d like to see ya. He owns AUNT STANLEY’s in the tenderloin. But listen: What’s the law doin to me?

MITCH
How did you get the idea I’m in any way connected with--

VINETTI
Everybody knows that you’re investigating the murder.

MITCH
Oh, for fucks’ sake--

VINETTI
--I didn’t kill Julia Wolfe. You have to make them believe you. I haven’t seen her for three months.

MITCH
I’m not in contact with the police and I have no idea why they’d believe me if I did. 

Several hard knocks from the front door.

VINETTI
Don’t answer that.

MITCH
Why don’t you tell them yourself?

VINETTI
Our interests don’t, shall we say “align”.

BILLY
(more-than-slightly attracted)
Because you’re a... gangster?

VINETTI
I’m a Cannabis Entrepreneur. I even got my own strain.

BILLY
Now that is something you’ve never had, MITCH. Your own strain of marijuana. Do you have anything that compliments the winery we own? They mostly produce a Pinot Grigio that’s pretty dry.

VINETTI
I got a smooth indica that would go real nice.

BILLY
What would the initial investment be on something like that?

VINETTI
Well, it depends on what kind of marketing--

More knocks from the front door.

VINETTI
Ignore it. They’ll go away. 
(to MITCH)
I wouldn’t have any reason to hurt Julia. She was always a little sweet on me.

BILLY
I must say, MITCH, he seems very trustworthy.

GILD (O.S.)
Sausalito PD. Open up!

VINETTI
How did you... 

MITCH
Nobody called them.

BILLY
We were all in bed until you arrived.

From the living room, we hear Max let the COPS in. Vinetti is momentarily distracted.

VINETTI
You son of a--

MITCH pushes Billy off the bed and onto the floor and throws a bong from the side table at Vinetti who fires the gun. MITCH falls off the bed onto the floor.

TWO COPS rush in, wrestling the gun away from Vinetti. Max rushes to help MITCH. 

Billy has hit his forehead on the edge of a nearby ottoman and is out cold.

.IN THE LIVING ROOM - LATER

Billy holds a cold compress on his forehead. Max tends to MITCH’s chest. 

BILLY
You mean, I missed the whole damn thing?

MAX
(to MITCH)
You’re lucky it just grazed your nipple. 

MITCH
I’ll never be able to wear a two-piece swimsuit again. Should we call a doctor?

MAX
I am a licensed doctor in my country. It’s shallow. There’s a lot of bleeding but you’ll be fine.

DETECTIVE JOHN GILD (50’s, IN CHARGE and comfortable with that) points to the door, indicating the UNIFORMED OFFICER should take Vinetti out of the room.

GILD
A couple of inches one way or the other and you’d be a lot worse, Mr. Charles. I’m Detective John Gild.
(extending a hand)

MITCH
Pleased to meet you. How did you guys know to be here?

GILD
We heard some rumors that this place was where the WYNANT’s family and his lawyer and everybody kept showing up, so we decided to keep an eye on the house. So this morning when this guy starts snooping around, well, it’s pretty lucky for you we did.

MITCH
Yes, Pretty lucky for me or I wouldn’t have gotten shot.

GILD
This guy a friend of yours?

MITCH
Never seen him before.

GILD
What did he want?

MITCH
He wanted to tell me he didn’t kill the Wolfe girl.

GILD
What’s that to you?

MITCH
Nothing.

GILD
What did he think it was to ya’?

MITCH
Ask him. I don’t know.

GILD
I’m asking ya.

MITCH
Keep on asking.

GILD
So are you going to swear to the complaint on him shooting you?

MITCH
I can’t answer that one either.

GILD
(to minion cop)
Toss the joint.

MITCH
Not without a warrant.

MINION COP
We got more than probable cause?!

GILD
Do it.

MINION COP starts barking orders to the COPS waiting in the next room.

MINION COP
Make sure you bag everything of interest and leave no stones unturned.

The COPS fan out across the house.

.LIVING ROOM

MINION COP opens a drawer and retrieves the gun MITCH took off Donnie on the end of a pen, dropping it in a plastic bag... 

.BEDROOM

...carrying it to Gild.

GILD
Have you got a gun permit?

MITCH
No.

GILD
Then what are you doing with that?

MITCH shifts in bed, grimacing in pain.

GILD
Let me ask that question another way: Is this gun yours?

MITCH
No.

GILD
Then who’s is it?

MITCH
I have no idea.

GILD
How did it get in your drawer?

Leaning back into bed: relief from the pain.

MITCH
(Judy Garland voice)
“People come and go so quickly here.”

BILLY
(thinking out loud)
Just the other day we had a few guests over for a pool party. I suppose one of the clothed ones could have snuck it in.

GILD
Listen, Mr. Charles, I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know what hole in your side isn’t doing your disposition any favors. Can we just agree to discuss this in a formal context sometime soon during business hours?

MITCH
(meaning it)
Nothing would make me happier.

GILD
I hope you feel better. I’ll be in touch.
(then on the way out)
Mr. Charles.

BILLY
It’s been a pleasure, detective. 

MINION COP comes back in and hands BILLY a small box.

MINION COP
Vinetti wanted you to have this box of pre-roll.

BILLY
Awwww. Isn’t that sweet?

MITCH
Only the best drugs in this house.

MINION COP: exit. MITCH winces as he shifts positions.

MITCH
I wouldn’t mind one of those right about now.

BILLY lights the joint. They pass-and-share.

BILLY
Why don’t we just get out of town. We could run away to Fiji or something.

MITCH
I’m in it now. No getting out of this city until we see this through.

BILLY
I suppose if we go anywhere it will just make us look guilty.

MITCH
And what happens if that gun turns out to be the one that killed Julia Wolfe?

BILLY
You think it is?

MITCH
I think if the police don’t already know, they will soon.

BILLY
Is there anything we can actually do?

MITCH
I need to get ahead of this. 
(smoking, contemplative)
In order to figure out what to do, I have to figure out what’s being done to me. I need to go on a fact-finding expedition.

BILLY
I just love being on exhibition! Can I go?

PRELAP: “FELL IN LOVE WITH A BOY”

MITCH
Tomorrow, how about an evening visiting our Aunt Stanley?

Billy picks up his phone and hits a number from favorites.

BILLY
I’m declaring a fashion emergency. First thing in the morning... Bring. Me. Options.

INT. THE MANS - MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

A montage of Billy trying on clothes attended by multiple CLOTHING GAYS, each outfit more fabulous than the previous--head-to-toe plaid, then emerald green, a pink velvet suit...

Quick Cuts: Mani, Pedi, Massage, Hair, a little concealer... 

EST. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

The Transamerica pyramid, Fisherman’s Warf at night, Bay Bridge looming in the background, lights blinking. We pan... 

IN LIGHTS: **AUNT STANLEY’S SUPPER CLUB**

San Francisco fog swirls...

REVEAL: Billy as he steps out of the Rolls--arriving as if the Met Gala or Oscars--dressed for a cool evening--A Jacket ensemble--perfect head to toe. 

MITCH meets him at his arm dressed in a dapper fitted vintage suit color-keyed to BILLY’s outfit, that makes him look like a golden-age movie star.

We follow them into...

INT. AUNT STANLEY’S SUPPER CLUB - NIGHT

.LOBBY

On making an entrance, Billy de-cloaks to reveal an even more chic look underneath that sparkles when the light hits it.

MITCH pauses to look at a framed photo on the wall. In the front, Clive WYNANT surrounded by his staff. (Observant people will also find Kris Jyorgensen somewhere near the back)

MITCH hands off their coats to a HAT CHECK BOI and rejoins Billy making an entrance to... 

.THE CABARET

AUNT STANLEY (50’s, would win RuPaul’s drag race, but considers it bougie to enter), is in the middle of a performance art drag act choreographed with a gaggle of dancing muscle queens. 

The song is “FELL IN LOVE WITH A BOY” and it’s sung by a decisively male low-baritone voice.

The music finishes, then Aunt Stanley steps forward to the mic:

AUNT STANLEY
(from the stage)
I am AUNT STANLEY; This is Aunt Stanley's Supper club and the charges tonight will show up on your credit card as “SEX DUNGEON” so make sure you use the one your spouse doesn't know about.

The crowd roars and Billy and MITCH are led to their table.

AUNT STANLEY
Thank you for coming out tonight. Now put your hands together for some really talented artists... **THE SHE GEES**.

The music starts. Before they sit, MITCH offers his hand to BILLY and they walk to the dance floor. 

.ON THE DANCE FLOOR

BILLY & MITCH dance to “MORE THAN A WOMAN” as performed on stage by THE SHE GEES, a drag Bee Gee’s cover band. 

The rest of the world disappears and it’s just the two of them dancing on rainbow-colored flashing LED floor-squares.

Billy sparkles like a Christmas tree and MITCH is one-hundred percent, balls-deep in love.

The song ends and they dip, then kiss.

.AT THE TABLE

When Billy & MITCH return to their table, drinks await.

AUNT STANLEY (O.S.)
I wish you’d look what the cat drug onto my porch.

Aunt Stanley sits at the table with them and sucks on a vape blowing smoke into the space over the table.

MITCH
You’re one to talk... Sending all your riff-raff to my house.

Billy and Aunt Stanley share a Hollywood kiss.

MITCH
You wouldn’t know how a certain “cannabis entrepreneur” got my address?

AUNT STANLEY
The instagram post--It’s all anyone can talk about--from your pool party...???

Billy whips out his phone and starts clicking.

MITCH
What instagram post?

Billy holds the phone so MITCH can see: A photo of MITCH, Billy  and Mimi WYNANT laughing, holding drinks at the pool party. 

BILLY
When he tagged the location, it was like putting a big red X on the house.

Billy clicks on the photo’s location data and shows a map with a drop-pin over the Marin mans.

AUNT STANLEY
So, you think that WYNANT guy really offed his secretary?

MITCH
It wouldn’t surprise me.

AUNT STANLEY
Me either. I never liked the old man.

BILLY
How did you know him?

They all sit at the table and drinks are waiting for them.

AUNT STANLEY
We did an escape room upstairs for Rosewater Software C-suite one Christmas. Before he and Rosewater had that big falling out about the IPO.

MITCH
IPO? I thought they were bought by Apple? 

AUNT STANLEY
They prepped the company for an IPO and right at the last minute, the board accepted Apple’s buyout.

MITCH
So then Rosewater blamed WYNANT for making him miss out on a billion dollar IPO.

AUNT STANLEY
(nodding)
Whatever the case, you need to know that Vinetti didn’t kill Julia Wolfe. He was here the whole day of the murder. 

MITCH
The whole day?

AUNT STANLEY
I got a little apartment upstairs. We were there for over twenty-four hours doin ‘shrooms and working out a new act. Does that mean WYNANT killed her?

MITCH
Not sure. Probably.

AUNT STANLEY
What about you?

BILLY
What about me?

AUNT STANLEY
Your reputation precedes you. When you gonna work out a show for me? From what I’ve heard, you’ve got more talent in your pinky than all these tired old queens put together.

Billy starts to answer, but the table is distracted by the stage as the She Gee’s finish their set. Everyone claps.

AUNT STANLEY
I gotta go do a thing. I’ll be back in a bit.

Excusing themself, Aunt Stanley returns to the stage.

.ON STAGE

### SHOT: a lively cabaret with a warm orange color palette and geometric patterns. In the center, Aunt Stanley, a genderqueer performer with a dark beard, stands confidently on stage under a dramatic spotlight. Aunt Stanley is wearing a contrasting green dress and long green gloves, along with a sparkling tiara. In front of Aunt Stanley is an old-style vintage radio microphone with a large rounded grille on a stand. The audience is visible in the foreground from behind, seated at round cafe tables with small lamps, watching the performance. The mood is vibrant, stylish, and elegant, echoing the bold, simplified forms and textured finish of mid-century modern poster art.


AUNT STANLEY
~ I believe in star signs
~ and I believe in film romances...

BILLY sings “(I believe) THE LIES OF HANDSOME MEN.”

.MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS

Music continues.

- INT. MCCOWLEY’S OFFICE - MCCOWLEY stacks money from an envelope into a grey safe.

- INT. APARTMENT - Donnie enters a stark, modern apartment, locking the door behind him. He walks past a picture window with a million dollar view of San Francisco’s financial district.

- EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - Kris Jyorgansen tosses papers into a burning garbage can. 

INT. AUNT STANLEY’S SUPPER CLUB - NIGHT

Back-lights come up and there’s a JAZZ ORCHESTRA silhouetted behind Billy. 

BILLY
~ But even though he’s hooked me on his line
~ I find the pleasure has been mine...

A MUTED CORNET PLAYER silhouette plays a solo--Shadow projected ten feet tall behind Billy.

.MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS

Music continues.

- INT. MCCOWLEY’S OFFICE - McCowley closes the safe and spins the combination lock.

- INT. APARTMENT - In the apartment, an OLDER MAN awaits Donnie and Donnie kisses him passionately.

- EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - Jyorgansen tosses a gun in the water along with the bullets, one at a time.

INT. AUNT STANLEY’S SUPPER CLUB - NIGHT

BILLY
~ Someday I’ll catch wise
~ But right now I need the lies
~ Of handsome men.

The performance brings down the house.

# THE C SUITE

SUPER: The “C” Suite

INT. WYNANT HOUSE - THE RICHMOND DISTRICT - YOUTUBE VIDEO

YOUNGER MITCH is interviewing WYNANT in a 4:3 aspect clip with “video tape lines” distorting the image (continuing the interview from before):

MITCH
I want to go back to the beginning: How did you meet Mr. Rosewater?

WYNANT
It was a tech meetup. In the valley. We both were interested in Object Oriented--

MITCH
--Before you get too technical, remember most of the audience doesn’t have a Ph.D. in Information Systems from Stanford.

WYNANT smiles. 

WYNANT
Victor and I were both programmers--Interested in the same languages and development patterns.

MITCH
You wanted the same things.

WYNANT
I thought we did.

MITCH
Until?

WYNANT
The Mercury News printed a story that Rosewater Software was in talks to be acquired by Apple.

MITCH
Lucky you. 

WYNANT
Right? That’s what I thought.

MITCH
He wasn’t happy?

WYNANT
Victor said he didn’t want the “ROSEWATER” name to be seen as a “sellout”. To which I replied “Then why the hell are you in Silicon Valley?”

Playback pauses.

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

MITCH, Billy and Inspector Gild are watching paused video of the interview on a large screen. The screen is frozen on WYNANT’s full-moon face.

GILD
What happened to Rosewater back then?

MITCH
Good question. Another good question: Where is he now?

BILLY
You think he killed Julia Wolfe?

MITCH
If he came looking for WYNANT again and Julia Wolfe was the only thing that stood in his way,
(shrugs)
I think it's at least a possibility.

BILLY
If he was so bent on revenge against WYNANT, why did he stop?

MITCH
Yet another good question.

GILD
There were never any charges filed against Rosewater--we checked. He seems to have just dropped off the map after the Apple purchase. We can’t even find a picture.

MITCH
How does one "Drop off the map" in this day and age?

BILLY
Oh, it's easy. I know a guy.

MITCH
(incredulously amused)
Do you?

BILLY
Oh, sure. Yeah. For about ten grand, if we needed to we could get new passports and ID's and... 

MITCH
And what? Spend the rest of our lives as someone else in the south of France?

BILLY
You don’t want to go to France. Uruguay is the safe bet. No extradition.

GILD
Pardon me while I make some notes.

MITCH
How long was it between when Apple bought Rosewater Electronics and WYNANT started WYNANTek?

GILD
About two years. 

EXT. I-280 - HEADED SOUTH - DAY

The Rolls barrels south down I-280 with the scenic San Andreas park to the right and million dollar homes to the left. 

BILLY (V.O.)
What does WYNANTek actually do?

The afternoon sea mist curls over the mountains and dissipates as it touches the warmer south-bay air.

GILD (V.O.)
I’ve been trying to find out myself.

The Rolls takes the exit labeled “SAND HILL ROAD” and merges into what passes for traffic in the entrepreneurial north end of Silicon Valley. 

MITCH (V.O.)
They have a bunch of security contracts with the Defense Department. 

The Rolls passes several nondescript suburban offices and pull into passenger drop-off of a building labeled WYNANTECH.

INT. WYNANT TECH - DAY

Silicon Valley Office done in quirky-novelty-corporate-chic. 

MITCH (V.O.)
They make software that detects intrusions.

One wall of the lobby is a floor-to-ceiling black-and-white-herb-ritz style fashion photo of the founder, Clive WYNANT pensively biting his glasses--Looking significantly thinner.

GILD
We’re here to see Mr. Nunheim.

All of the seating in the lobby is more art than furniture.

RECEPTIONIST
And who may I say is calling?

RECEPTIONIST (20’s white, dreads, nose-ring and tattooed neck) Sits behind a “STATEMENT” desk in the shape of the company logo.

GILD
Detective John Gild, Sausalito PD.

RECEPTIONIST
Very good. And you are?
(asking MITCH)

MITCH
Kinda thirsty. 

BILLY
Me too. I don’t suppose you have a cocktail shaker of gin behind that desk do you?

RECEPTIONIST
I’m sorry, no. We have some blackberry seltzer water if you’d care for a bottle?

MITCH and BILLY: tight gay-judgey-smile with a head tilt:

MITCH
Pass.

BILLY ^
Pass.

GILD (PRELAP)
We were hoping you could tell us about the last time you saw Mrs. Wolfe.

INT. WYNANT TECH - INTERIM CEO’S OFFICE - DAY

MITCH, Billy, Gild, NUNHEIM (40’s, former Code-Bro turned management) and TWO LAWYERS sit around a conference table.

LAWYER #1
Mister Nunhiem asks that you direct your questions to me.

Nunheim sits smugly and lets his lawyer do the talking.

GILD
Then can you tell us where Mister Nunheim was at the time of the murder?

LAWYER #2
Mister Nunheim was at his home in Palm Springs the day of the murder and drove back to San Jose the day after. We have video cam footage… 
(from a file in front of him, he takes a piece of paper--a printed photo)
…of him entering and leaving the compound all day long, and his phone’s GPS
(another piece of paper)
…confirms that he never left Palm Springs until the day after the murder.

Nunheim smiles smugly and MITCH takes his Audrey Hepburn vape out of his pocket, clenching it between his teeth.

LAWYER #1
You can’t smoke in here.

MITCH
Oh, I’m not going to smoke. I just have it in my mouth to make you uncomfortable.

GILD
Correct me if I’m wrong, here but you were also WYNANT’s number two man at Rosewater, weren’t you.

LAWYER #2
Mr. Nunheim was the CFO of Rosewater Software. Again, I’ll ask you to direct your questions--

GILD
So you know Rosewater?

LAWYER #2
As CFO, he would have dealings with--

GILD
Great, do you know where he is or have information on where he might be... or even have any pictures--?

LAWYER #1
I’m sorry, pictures...???

GILD
We’ve been trying to get a hold of Mr. Rosewater but from what we can see he doesn’t exist--

Gild is interrupted by Nunheim’s phone making the “WHOOSHING” noice of a sent message. Both LAWYER’S PHONE “beep” in response.

When LAWYER #2 turns his head to look at Nunheim, MITCH lets out a small puff of vape.

LAWYER Looks at his phone and takes a deep breath. Pressing a button, a photo appears on the room’s large conference screen.

The photo is of Clive WYNANT with KRISTOBAL JYORGANSEN (AKA “ROSEWATER”) in front of a ROSEWATER SOFTWARE sign, Bestie-hugging.

Gild, Billy and MITCH exchange looks. MITCH marijuana-coughs.

BILLY
I don’t understand.

MITCH
Rosewater got his revenge... by marrying Mimi. Jyorgansen is Rosewater.

BILLY
(aghast)
Mimi’s going to be devastated.

MITCH
(evil smile)
I know. Let’s go tell her.

INT. JYORGANSEN-WYNANT HOUSE - DAY

A large crystal decanter hits the wall exploding into pieces beside MITCH’s head. 

MITCH
All things considered, I think she’s taking it very well.

Beside him, Billy, agrees, preparing to duck.

A plate explodes into shards over Billy’s shoulder as he cringes.

MITCH approaches Mimi and stops her hand mid-throw.

She uses her other hand to smack him.

He smacks her back.

She uses her fists to beat on his chest and he picks her up and carries her into...

INT. JYORGANSEN-WYNANT HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

MITCH throws her on the bed and she bounces around, trying to sit up. 

Mimi gets almost into a sitting position and MITCH pushes her back down. Then Again. When he pushes her the third time she screams in frustration and kicks her legs.

Donnie’s at the door.

MITCH
(to donnie)
Can you get her a Xanax and a glass of water. 

DONNIE
Oh, she’s got WAAAAY better shit than that. 

Donnie disappears into the hallway.

MIMI
(sitting up)
Why aren’t the police doing anything about this? Why haven’t they--

The sentence was interrupted by MITCH pushing Mimi back down on the bed.

MITCH
The police are doing everything they can. As soon as they find him, they will arrest him.

Donnie re-enters with a glass of water and a closed hand. He hands pills off to MITCH who holds it out for Mimi. 

She succeeds in sitting upright on the bed then refuses to take the pill.

MITCH
(getting in her face)
I’d rather not have to shove this down your throat and stroke your neck like a dog, but I will if I have to.

MIMI
(taking the pill and water)
Threaten me with a good time.

MITCH
What is this anyway?
(meaning the pills)

Mimi swallows the pill, right as Donnie jabs her arm with a needle and presses in the plunger.

MIMI
What did you...!? Oh, Fuuuuu--

Mimi drops lifeless to the bed.

DONNIE
The pills were just aspirin.
(holding up the needle)
But I use them as a distraction for the clozapine. 
(then)
Drinks?

BILLY
Yes, please.

MITCH ^
Dear God, yes.

INT. JYORGANSEN-WYNANT HOUSE - PATIO - LATER

At the bar on the patio, MITCH handles a cocktail shaker like a pro and pours out a drink for Himself, Donnie and Billy.

DONNIE
They’ve changed what they call it a couple of times since I was a kid. It used to be called a “Fugue state.” Now they just call it a “Dissociative Episode”.

BILLY
Do you think if she was having one of these “episodes”, she could have killed Julia Wolfe?

DONNIE
I’d like to say “It’s impossible” but I can’t say that.

They all sit in comfortable patio chairs and watch the orange-red sun set over San Francisco Bay.

BILLY
I can’t imagine growing up with that.

DONNIE
The mental illness? Oh, no. That’s easy enough to handle. You just knock her out with some drug and she wakes up herself again. The thing I can’t handle is the fact that she’s a compulsive liar. It’s like she would, actually, rather lie than tell the truth.

MITCH
That was my assessment the first time I met her. She lies and when you catch her in the lie she lies again until she wears you down and you just accept her fiction at face value. 

BILLY
Here’s to “WARGAMES.” The only way to win is not to play.

Lifting his drink, they all concur.

A beat passes while They pass around a joint.

DONNIE
Kris didn’t come home last night. 

MITCH
When was the last time anyone has seen him?

DONNIE
We came home from the pool party and he slept in his office.

MITCH and Billy exchange looks: “Are you thinking what i’m thinking?

MITCH
“Office?”

.KRIS’ OFFICE

Billy, and MITCH search Kris’s laptop as Donnie enters.

DONNIE
Find anything?

MITCH
(lifting a stack of magazines)
Vintage Porn.

DONNIE
(intrigued)
Oh? 

BILLY
For straight guys.

DONNIE
Ew. Pass.

MITCH
(wiping dust off a shelf with his finger)
Doesn’t look like he spent much time here.

BILLY
(Flipping through a stack)
Nude photos of a woman.

DONNIE
Oh?

MITCH
It’s your mother.

DONNIE
Well, I’ll leave you to it then.

Donnie abruptly leaves MITCH and Billy alone. A beat passes as they dig.

BILLY
Tell me the truth about something...???

MITCH
If I know what the truth is.

BILLY
When you were carrying her across the floor like that...

MITCH
Yeah?

BILLY
You got a little bit hard, didn’t you?

From a dusty book, MITCH is distracted by a piece of paper... reading... showing it to Billy. Large type reads: CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE, STATE OF NEBRASKA.

BILLY
Nebraska? Why would they go to--

MITCH
**They** wouldn’t. It is Rosewater.

BILLY
But the spouse isn’t Mimi?

MITCH
(shaking his head “no”)
Kris is Rosewater and Mimi’s a bigamist.

BILLY
She’s going to need to get a lawyer.

MITCH
And Donnie’s going to need to get more clozapine.

Billy turns to leave; MITCH stops him.

MITCH
(sotto)
Stiff. As. A. Board.

Eyes, locked... They kiss.

# CHAPTER 6

## Shot - 6.1

OVER BLACK:

BILLY (O.S.)
Picture it: In the darkest days of the pandemic. A handsome photojournalist was taking photos of the chaos at a hospital--

CHIRON: **CHAPTER 6: “It was the “fuck around”-est of times; It was the “find-out”-est of times;”**

MITCH (O.S.)
“It was the “fuck around”-est of times; It was the “find-out”-est of times;”--

Straight People chuckle and yes, you can tell they’re straight by their laugh with no visuals.

## PRESENT DAY: HOUSE PARTY

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

### TRACKING: Mitch

INVESTMENT KLATCH, SOCIAL CLIMBERS, gather in a living room. Everyone’s focus is on Billy, telling a story.

BILLY
(adding drama)
The seminal visual storybook of one of America’s darkest chapters...

MITCH (O.S.)
You and I remember that those days very differently.

MITCH has interrupted, appearing from around the corner in the kitchen, drinks-in-hand--He hands one to Billy.

BILLY
Excuse me, I am entitled to my delusions. They are, after all, the only thing I truly own.

This gets a chuckle from the straights.

MITCH
This is California, Darling. All delusions are community property.

Bigger laugh. Billy accepts MITCH’s kiss , passes by on his way to...

### TRACKING: MITCH - Down the hall toward the Kitchen

.KITCHEN

MITCH and FOTH (The Female owner of the house) have to turn sideways to walk down the house hallway in opposite directions.

MITCH
(to FOTH)
Are there any more of those little--

FOTH
Yeah, in there on the counter.

MITCH
Such a lovely party. You have a beautiful home

FOTH
Oh, thanks. It’s just so good to see you and Billy. Tell me have you heard anything about that billionaire and--

MITCH
(dismissive)
Nobody tells me anything.

MITCH continues toward the kitchen. Before he can get there, A bathroom door opens and Donnie pulls him in.

### TWO SHOT: MITCH & DONNIE in BATHROOM

.BATHROOM

DONNIE
Is he out there?

MITCH
Is who out there?

DONNIE ^
SHHHHHH! Traff Hickson.

MITCH 
I didn’t see him.

DONNIE
I think he’s already here somewhere.

MITCH
Which explains you being in the bathroom, how exactly?

DONNIE
He says he wants to have a conversation about our relationship.

MITCH
That’s never a good sign.

DONNIE
Right?

MITCH
So what is your plan? Stay here and avoid him?

DONNIE
When are you leaving?

MITCH
As soon as I can. Billy has an agenda.

DONNIE
What agenda?

MITCH
Need to know basis. But as soon as he’s done, we’re gone.

DONNIE
Can I get a ride home with you?

MITCH
(leaving bathroom)
Sure.

## Shot - 6.2

### TRACKING: MITCH

.HALLWAY

MITCH reenters the hallway from the bathroom and runs into McCowley.

### TRACKING: MITCH & McCowley down the hallway to the kitchen

MCCOWLEY
Hey! I was looking for you.

MITCH
Well, ya found me!

### TWO SHOT W/GAP: MITCH AND MCCOWLEY

MITCH and McCowley turn toward the kitchen and as they do, Donnie sneaks out of the bathroom in the opposite direction.

MCCOWLEY
Well, I was just hoping you could introduce me to--

MITCH
The investments guy... yeah, he’s here somewhere. I’ll keep my eye open for him.

### Two Shot: Mitch & McCowley, Hallway silhouetted by the living room light, headed toward the kitchen

MCCOWLEY
(almost under his breath)
Hey, Who do the police suspect now for the murder?

MITCH
I wouldn’t know.

MCCOWLEY
I thought with your 
🎙️story and everything--

MITCH^
🎙️Oh, for the love of--
I’m not doing any story-- 

MCCOWLEY
Well, I just--

MITCH^
People keep jumping to all those conclusions about me. 

MCCOWLEY
I can’t believe--
And with that--

MITCH ^
I’m starting to really hate the way people naturally confide in me
 

MCCOWLEY
--rosewater  thing--

MITCH^
You knew more about rosewater than I ever did. Why didn’t you say something to Mimi--

MCCOWLEY
--Mimi? Why would I talk to her about rosewater?

Mitch gives McCowley a long look, trying to determine if he’s being honest, makes a decision.

MITCH
Rosewater married Mimi under a fake name. 

Mitch watches McCowley react.

MCCOWLEY
(mind blown)
How did he--?

(beat)

MCCOWLEY
I never met her new husband. How was I supposed to know it was her first husband’s business partner? I haven’t even seen her since they finished that

MITCH^
All you had to do was open your eyes to what was right in front of you.

MCCOWLEY
--construction on the house.

MITCH
What construction on the house?

MCCOWLEY
They pulled up the floor and re-did the floorboards with the Wynanant tech logo.

MITCH
When was this?

MCCOWLEY
What does it matter? It’s just some construction.

McCowley walks toward the kitchen.

Mitch whips out his phone and texts GILD:

MITCH (text message)
Pull the permits for the construction work on the Richmond House.

The answer comes back quickly: 👍

Mitch follows McCowley into the kitchen.

Kitchen Klatch #1 approaches, reaching for the serving tray of sandwiches behind MITCH.

KITCHEN KLATCH #1
Are you guys going to burning man this year?

MCCOWLEY
Probably not.

MITCH
Did they move it to the Ritz Carlton in Palm Springs?

KITCHEN KLATCH #1
Uh, I don’t think so.

MITCH
Then no. I’m all in favor of music and recreational drugs, I just don’t enjoy getting sweaty and dirty and ... you know... urinating outdoors. But I think if you do, it’d be fun.

KITCHEN KLATCH #1 grabs a sandwich, napkin and moves on.

## Shot - 6.3

### Shot: Mitch looking at the couple making out. McCowley looking from Mitch to couple

Mitch gives a side-glance to a couple that are standing up in the kitchen corner, making out.

MCCOWLEY
I thought you hated house parties like this. 

MITCH
Oh, I do, Billy made me attend. He’s a man on a mission.

MCCOWLEY
What Mission?

Suddenly, Billy is standing in between them.

BILLY
Need to know basis. I could tell you but I’d have to kill you.

### TRACKING: BILLY

and we follow BILLY through the kitchen and outside, watching Mitch shrug at McCowley in the background.

.PATIO

ON BILLY: We follow his eye across the patio, looking beyond to the yard. He nears the INVESTMENT KLATCH (IK#1, IK#2, & IK#3) gathered around the grill waiting for burgers.

BILLY
(to INVESTMENT KLATCH #1)
Have you seen--

IK#1
You already asked me that. I haven’t seen her.

BILLY
She still hasn’t come by here?

IK#2
Why are you looking--?

BILLY
I just need to talk to her. Can you tell her--?

IK#1
No.

BILLY
I mean if she comes by again.

IK#1
Still no.

BILLY
You can’t tell her I’m looking for her?

IK#2
He’s not speaking to her.

IK#1
Her husband’s IPO killed my port.

BILLY
You’re “PORT”?

IK#3
His Portfolio. The fund he manages.

IK#2
That IPO was a stinker.

IK#1
Almost got me fired.

IK#2
Gotta protect that port.

IK#1
Luckily a long shot came through and saved my quarter.

IK#3
Those Indonesian coal mines were cherry.

IK#2
Dude, Hand over fist.

IK#3
Saved your quarter 

IK#1
Saved my ass.

IK#3
Damn straight.

IK#2
Can you get me in on some of that Indonesian coal?

IK#1
How much you looking for.

IK#2
Three or four.

### TRACKING: BILLY walking away:

BILLY
Well, I’m very happy for your ass. Now if you’ll excuse me.

We follow Billy away, and as we walk away.

IK#1
I don’t think they’re bothering with anything less than 10.

IK#2
I don’t think I want to bet that big on Indonesia right now.

Donnie approaches Billy and passes him. 

DONNIE
Don’t leave without me.

BILLY
No Promises.

We follow Donnie back into the house. Donnie is cautiously looking around. Hoping... Praying... he doesn’t see.

From behind him a voice:

TRAFF
I’ve been looking all over for you.

### Two Shot over Billy’s Shoulder: Donnie--face to the camera; Traff Hickson pursuant

Donnie’s face sinks... He found me.

TRAFF
I’ve got something important to talk to you about.

DONNIE turns to him.

DONNIE
Can it wait until after the party?

TRAFF
It’s just when you figure out you want to spend the rest of your life with someone--

DONNIE
You have a wife and kids. You need to go home to them. 

### SHOT: Billy turns to the camera, rolling his eyes.

BILLY
Fucking twink drama.

### TRACKING BILLY

We follow Billy down the hall leaving Donnie and Traff on the patio.

TRAFF
I filed. The divorce is moving forward.

DONNIE (O.S.)
I don’t believe you.

Tracking Billy down, glimpsing CLIMBING KLATCH in the living room.

The bathroom door opens and MIMI pulls BILLY into the bathroom.

.BATHROOM

MIMI
What are you doing?

BILLY
I need to see--

MIMI
What are you possibly hoping to accomplish?

BILLY
I’m going to find out--

MIMI
You already know everything you need to.

BILLY
She’s the one planning the competing event with my mother.

MIMI
Correct. And the next question is...

BILLY
“Why”?

MIMI
More importantly...?

BILLY
What am I going to do about it?



The door to the bathroom opens and McCOWLEY is embarrassed that he interrupted something. 

MCCOWLEY
So sorry! My apologies. The door wasn’t locked--

BILLY
It’s no trouble, really. Us girls were just powdering our noses.

## Shot - 6.4

### TRACKING: McCOWLEY

.HALLWAY

As McCowley shuts the door to the bathroom, we hear:

BILLY (O.S.)
Do you have any suggestions?

McCowley passes the same couple making out in a different place--then to where CRYPTO BROS are crowded around a table with a watermelon, each with a piece.

As he does, one of the crypto bros spits a watermelon seed and the seed hits McCowley’s shoe.

CRYPTO BRO #1
Sorry, bro. 

CB#1 hands MCCOWLEY a napkin.

CB#2
(spits seeds in trash can)
Dude! Party foul! You’re supposed to spit those here.

Wiping off his shoe, McCowley takes a piece of watermelon and digs in. 

CB#1
(spits)
But they’re like bio-upgradable and shit.

CB#2
How’d you like it if I did that spit one on your Lambo.
(spits)

MCCOWLEY spits his first seeds into the trash can. The following lines are punctuated by seed spits and watermelon slurps.

CB#3
Dude! Don’t fuck with a guy’s Lambo.

MCCOWLEY
I thought you had a cyber-truck?

CB#3
His chick spray-pained dicks on it.

CB#2
Not cool.

CB#1
On both sides.

CB#2
Both sides of the dick?

CB#1
Both sides of the car.

CB#2
So not cool.

MCCOWLEY
Definitely not cool. Hey have you seen that investments guy? 

CB#1
Which one?

MCCOWLEY
...With the Indonesian coal thing--

CB#2
I got in on that. Dude, that bet was cherry. 

CB#1
I didn’t hear about this. Nobody told me.

CB#3
All happened super fast. By the time I got there it was gone.

MCCOWLEY
He said that... that it was sold through?

CB#3
I offered to buy a million and he told me he wasn’t interested. I assumed they were sold.

CB#1
Coulda been a minimum.

CB#3
I bet there was a minimum.

CB#1
Prolly something crazy like ten mil.

CB#2
You got ten mil to spend, you can buy most anything.

MCCOWLEY
Ok, well, if you see him.

CB#1
Is that him waiting for a burger?

MCCOWLEY
Yeah, that’s him. Thanks. 

### Tracking MCCOWLEY walking toward the Investment Klatch.

CB#1
You best not come near my fucking lambo.

CB#2
Dude! I would never. I was just sayin--

CB#1
I’m just sayin, don’t fuck with my lambo.

### TRACKING: MCCOWLEY ==> MIMI

MCCOWLEY crosses to Investment Klatch as MIMI passes. As they pass each other:

MIMI
Asshole.

MCCOWLEY^
Cunt.

### TRACKING: MIMI

We follow MIMI out of the backyard and inside the house to the living room.

.LIVING ROOM

CLIMBERS KLATCH 1, 2, & 3 are in the living room. 

SC#1
Oh, mimi, we were just talking about how we saw your husband just the other day.

MIMI
Oh, how nice for you.

SC#2
He was going into that pawn shop on Ferrell Street. 

MIMI
Well, if you see him, tell him the police are looking for him.

SC#1
How many missing husbands does that make for you?

The three of them laugh.

Mimi fake-smiles and continues past them.

### TRACKING: MIMI 

.HALLWAY

into the hallway. Right as she reaches the bathroom door, the door opens and Billy pulls her in.

### Two shot: MIMI <==> BILLY

.BATHROOM 

BILLY
I have an idea, but in order for it to work, I need to use your house in the Richmond.

Mimi reaches into the Birkin and finds a set of keys, tossing them to Billy, opening the door. We stay with Billy as she leaves.

MIMI
This bitch needs to go down.

Mimi exits right as Mitch sticks his head in the door.

### TRACKING: BILLY

MITCH
How’s it going?

BILLY
We’re leaving.

MITCH
What about the kid?

Donnie sticks his head in the door beside Mitch.

DONNIE
What kid?

BILLY
We’re leaving. 
(giving donnie the eye)
Remind me to stop and get some bridal magazines on the way home.

MITCH
Why would you want bridal magazines.

DONNIE
Because I might be getting married.

Donnie exit.

Mitch and Billy exchange a look. Billy shrugs.

Billy exit.

Mitch

MITCH
(to nobody)
uuuhhhhh ok?

INT. ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM - NIGHT

Billy gets in and immediately leans against the far window. 

DONNIE (O.S.)
Are you drunk?

As Donnie gets in and is seated, Billy starts to snore, ever so slightly.

BILLY
Of course not... zzzzzzzzzz

MITCH gets in and shuts the door behind him. Max drives.

MITCH
Nah, he had maybe two, three martinis--
(hiccup) 
--at the most. That’s not drunk, that’s lunch.

MITCH leans forward around Donnie to look at Billy and just stares for a beat. 

DONNIE
He’s cute when he sleeps.

MITCH
He’s cute when he does anything.

DONNIE
Tell it to me for real. The story of the day you met.

MITCH
Just lean against Billy and try to get some sleep. You can crash in our spare bedroom again.

DONNIE
What was wrong with the way Billy told the story?

MITCH, lost in thought...

MITCH
I just... remember it differently. That’s all. Go to sleep, boo bear.

The short burst from a police siren.

We notice they’re being followed by a police car with flashing lights. 

Max pulls the car over. 

Mitch rolls down the window... it’s Gild.

GILD
We found Wynant.

Donnie and Billy slowly shake themselves awake.

MITCH
Oh, yeah, where?

GILD
Under the floor boards of the Richmond house.

MITCH
Dead?

GILD
Very.

MITCH
Sure it’s him?

GILD
The injuries to his leg make it impossible it was anyone else.

GILD
And Donnie’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon. I’m afraid you’re going to have to come with me.

Donnie starts to speak. Mitch stops him.

MITCH
Don’t say a word. Let them book you and we’ll have a lawyer there in a couple of hours. 

The police take Donnie into custody as Mitch and Billy watch with worried faces.

As they’re putting Donnie in the police car, Donnie starts to speak to Mitch. Mitch stops him:

MITCH
Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Your lawyer will be there soon.

Donnie disappears into the police car and the arresting officer shuts the door behind him.

### TWO SHOT: MITCH <==> BILLY

Mitch and Billy watch the police car drive away.



## End chapter 6

===

{{PAGENUMBER: 701}}

# CHAPTER 7

*NOTE: At this point we’ve established that Rosewater and  and KRISTOBAL JYORGENSEN are the same person. In his rosewater persona, he’s a clean-cut average Silicon Valley CEO--Khaki pants and a button-down shirt that says “I’m just a regular guy just like the people I hire”. In his persona as JYORGENSEN he’s a him-bo wearing tight clothing that accentuates his ass, flat stomach and pecs. This is the first time we see him in his CEO persona and we’ll refer to him alternately as KRISTOBAL and ROSEWATER depending on the persona he embodies in the scene. He adopts either persona in a “Talented Mr. Ripley” kind of way, morphing into who he needs to be to convince his audience.*


### CU: A hand writes “1:20” on a white Dry-erase board.

### 3/4 shot of wining in front of the whiteboard containing the ratio he just wrote.

WYNANT turns around from writing.

WYNANT
The only real advice I can give you is that every success is built on top of twenty failures.

WYNANT addresses a lecture hall of adults of varying age.

WYNANT
I want you to make this the ratio that rules your life. In order to succeed in Silicon Valley, you need to let go of your view of success and failure and learn that *YOU* get to define what is a success or failure based on your own criterion. I’ve already taken up too much of your valuable time so I’ll hand you back over to your regular professor.

PROFESSOR
Everyone give a big round of applause to Silicon Valley Pioneer Clive Wynant.

The audience claps.


MITCH (O.S.)
They not going to let you in.

EXT. HOSPITAL - FLASHBACK

### LONG SHOT: Mitch taking photos near a hospital. He wears a mask.

Billy approaching--also in a mask. The air is so cold you can see their breath vapor coming through the cloth as they speak. 

BILLY
My sister works here but she got sick.

### Two Shot: Billy and Mitch in frame.

Billy tries to ignore Mitch as Mitch takes photos of the scene.

A large sign above them reads EMERGENCY ROOM, make-shift white tents and testing stations surround the entrance. Staff wear PPE approaching the level of HASMAT suits.

MITCH
They not going to let you in.

Annoyed, Billy walks. We follow him to the front door, but he is stopped by a masked security guard.

### Three Shot: Billy & Security Guard with Mitch in background

BILLY
‘Scuse me...

SECURITY GUARD
Sorry, we’re not allowing anyone other than patients and staff.

MITCH
(From a few feet away)
I told you.

BILLY
But my sister works here.

SECURITY GUARD
Do you understand the phrase “AIRBORNE VIRUS”?

SECURITY GUARD
Anytime you share the air--

BILLY^
I haven’t seen her in weeks. They said she was sick. I just need to talk--

SECURITY GUARD
If you love her, you will stay home and stay safe.

Billy turns 

### Tracking Shot: We follow billy away from guard, but keeping Mitch in frame, watching him go.

Billy stomps off into the snow-filled streets.

MITCH
Hey! Cute Angry Guy! Wanna get a drink?

Billy stops, turns.

= Six layoffs: Rosewater gets laid off of five different companies and decides to set out to build his own company.

BOSS #1
I’ve asked Jenna to join us from HR.

INT. APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

ROSEWATER
No, I’m going to start my own firm this time. And I’m going to go get the most savvy and entrepreneurial  minds in all of Silicon Valley.

VINETTI (PRELAP)
Is it kickin’ in yet?

WYNANT (PRELAP)
Not Yet.

Wynant takes a huge hit off a bong in the shape of “Welcoming Christ” statue.

VINETTI
Hey, man, be careful. Bong Jesus don’t play.

WYNANT
(finishing the hit)
I’m starting to believe in his power.
(stifiled-cough)

The room is hazy from the bong smoke. A pizza box lies open on the coffee table beside several other comedic bongs.



Vinetti and Wynant sit on a a couch behind the coffee table. Beyond them we see the San Francisco skyline through the window.

= Wynant and Vinetti have a conversation that gets progressively more stoned, until Wynant realizes he’s late for a meeting.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

ROSEWATER sits at a table with a “Firing squad” of board members, each with a folder in front of them. They flip through the pages in the folder as rosewater speaks.

ROSEWATER
After a thorough search, the committee has determined that this is the candidate we’re putting forward to the board for the position of CEO. His qualifications are excellent and he’s taken several other companies public.

BOARD MEMBER #1
What about--

ROSEWATER

On the other side of a glass wall, we see Wynant dressed in Silicon Valley office casual. 

= Wynant comes in and is introduced. Behind his back, Rosewater sniffs the air around him with his face saying “Is that pot I’m smelling?”

EST. THE HOBART BUILDING - DAY

Establishing shot of the Hobart building over-looking San Francisco’s financial district.

Fog rolls over the western hills and is starting to limit visibility as it makes its way down Market street.

INT. THE HOBART BUILDING - MCCOWLEY’S OFFICE - DAY

A law office done up in the Dark Academia theme back when it was considered “stuffy” and before it was popularized.

MCCOWLEY and WYNANT sit and discuss as Wynant smokes his vape and leans on the cane between his legs.

MCCOWLEY
You have to know, she’s going to come at you with everything she’s got.

WYNANT
What about the prenup?

MCCOWLEY
She’s the injured party. She’s got documentation of your affairs and--

WYNANT
Injured party my ass. I’ve put up with that woman’s--

MCCOWLEY
You don’t have to convince me. I’ve been here for all of it.

With effort and leaning on his cane, Wynant stands, limps across the room to the window, looking out over market street.

MCCOWLEY rises from his desk, pours a drink for himself and his client and joins him at the window. Wynant accepts the drink and takes the first sip.

WYNANT
I need to establish a trust to take care of the boy. 

MCCOWLEY
I can do that. But here’s the thing: If you’re going to do this sale to Apple, do it after the divorce is final.

WYNANT
Then she doesn’t get a piece of it. Smart.

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

DONNIE is doing MIMI’s nails:

DONNIE
You can’t fall apart.

MIMI
I’m falling apart.

DONNIE
You Can’t. Be strong.

MIMI
I can’t.

DONNIE
You can. You have to be.

MIMI
Everything in my body is telling me I can’t

DONNIE
I know that you can.

MIMI
How do you know that?

DONNIE
Where do you think I get it from? From Dad?

They both can’t help but laugh.

MIMI
Your father has a lot of strengths. Emotional perseverance is not one of them.

He kicked us out. With no warning? He can do that?

DONNIE
What do we have?

MIMI
We have our health. We have the apartment and about thirty days in cash. 

DONNIE
So what do we need to do.

MIMI
Make some money.

DONNIE
(agreeing)
Make some money.

EXT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - DAY

Outside of an an impressive house with a FOR SALE sign in the front yard. 

Mimi closes the door to her SUV she’s just parked on the street, Birkin in place on her arm.  She walks past the FOR SALE sign and up to the door. 

On the door is a lock-box with a keypad.

Mimi takes a business card from her purse, flipping it over and showing numbers on the back of the card. She presses the numbers into the keypad and the door unlocks and opens.

Mimi glances around as she enters.

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - DAY

= mimi burgles valuables from the for-sale house

EXT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - DAY

Coming out of the house, the owners of the house are returning.

OWNER #1
Sorry, who are you?

Mimi walks and talks a mile a minute without stopping.

MIMI
Hi, Karen Silverstein. Yeah, Melissa told me I could take a look. I have two buyers coming into town tomorrow and I needed to make sure this was a fit for them. You have a lovely home. I’m sure it will sell quickly.

Getting into the SUV, Mimi revs the engine and heads out.



EXT. THE CASTRO - NIGHT

They emerge from Harvey Milk station into the Castro on a busy Friday night. People of all shapes and sizes walk up and down both sides of the street and the streetcar passes with a RING RING and a low rumble.

Donnie follows A&G down Castro, watches as he gives the BOUNCER at a club air kisses, then enters.

Donnie approaches the BOUNCER.

BOUNCER
ID & Five dollar cover, please.

Donnie makes a show of taking off his shirt, lifting his hands over his head, showing off the V of his torso disappearing into the top of his form-fitting jeans.

As he’s taking it off, Bouncer looks him up and down. While the shirt is over his face, bouncer leans in slight sniffing the Pitt-hair.

A sly smile: The bouncer inclines his head slightly, in the direction of the door to the club and Donnie, stuffing the shirt into the back of his pants, enters.

INT. 440 CASTRO - CONTINUOUS

Donnie makes his way through the club getting eye-fucked by literally everyone he passes. He doesn’t notice any of them. His eyes are glued to the target.

His target from the train sits at the bar. The BARTENDER has just finished making a drink, hands it to A&G, who then sips--pinky extended--and nods that it’s acceptable. 

Donnie’s face says “BINGO. That’s what I’m looking for.”

Walking up to A&G, then past him, Donnie, accidentally on purpose spills some of the mans drink on his bare chest, giggling like a twelve-year-old at the cold liquid touching him. 

DONNIE
OH MY GOD, I’m sooooo sorry!!!!! Wow, that’s so cold it’s making my nipples hard.

When the man glances down at the nipples, Donnie takes the mans free hand and traces the line of the drink with the mans finger all the way up his chest pulling it to his mouth to suck off the liquor.

DONNIE
Will you forgive me?
(licking again)
I just love Old Fashioned’s. Especially when they’re extra sweet.

A&G gives a nod to the watching bartender, who with a sly smile, makes a drink for Donnie.

INT. MCCOWLEY HOME - NIGHT

= McCowley arrives home to be arranged by his wife and a child that won’t stop crying. The wife hands him the baby and leaves the room, complaining about the bills that aren’t paid.


### TWO SHOT: Billy & Mitch sharing a drink outside a liquor store.

They drink outside a liquor store in the freezing cold from paper cups, Masks on their chin. Accumulated snow on the ground.

BILLY
Why are you here anyway?

MITCH
I’m putting together a photo essay about the pandemic... So we can remember the way things are.

In the background, people buy from the liquor store from walk-up window not allowing anyone to go inside.

BILLY
Why would you want to do that?

MITCH
Because it’s important--

BILLY
Important to whom? The dead people?

MITCH
Those who do not learn history are condemned--

BILLY
One of the best things about us as humans is our ability to process trauma and move beyond it. If we constantly relived the past, we’d never get anywhere.




INT. THE GEEZER’S APARTMENT - MORNING

= Donnie wakes and sees several hundred dollar bills on the dresser. He takes them all and all the cash from the wallet sitting nearby.

= On public transit, donnie makes his back to his parked car: a beat-up Toyota Corolla. Putting it in gear, he gets on the 101 south. 

= Donnie gets off the 101 at Menlo Park passing a SUN MICROSYSTEMS BUILDING with a sign over the Sun Microsystems that reads FUTURE HOME OF “FACEBOOK” - FALL, 2011. Behind the signs, construction is happening on the campus.

= 

### TWO-SHOT: Mitch & Billy

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

BILLY
Why would you want to do that?

MITCH
Because it’s important--

BILLY
Important to who? The dead people?

MITCH
Those who do not learn history are condemned--

Billy’s phone beeps.

They look at each other, dreading the notification.

Billy hands the phone to MITCH. 

BILLY
I can’t look. I don’t want to look.

MITCH taking the phone.

BILLY
She’s Dead. My sister is dead, isn’t she?

MITCH looks at the ground, then at him and just nods “YES.”

MITCH
I’m so sorry. If it’s any consolation I know how you feel.

BILLY
How could you except if--

Billy sees the same pain in MITCH that he’s experiencing right in this moment.

MITCH
I recently--

BILLY
I’m sorry, who was it?

MITCH
My husband. Cancer. Late last year.

### CU: MITCH & BILLY EMBRACE

MITCH approaches Billy to hug him, Billy warns him off but MITCH continues in spite of the protest. 

When they touch, Billy can hold it back no longer... Billy sobs in an ugly-cry worthy of an Oscar win.

MITCH
Pandemic be damned. If I can’t embrace a hurting friend, I don’t know why I’m alive anyway.

A beat as Billy sobs quietly into MITCH’s shoulder.

BILLY
(through sobs)
When she worked with Doctors Without Borders, I started imagining how I would get the news. I could imagine illness and death. But I never imagined she’s be so alone. She was there. In that hospital all alone. And now she’s just... Gone. It’s such an ignoble way to end for someone who was such an amazing person. It’s an insult.

MITCH kisses his forehead gently never letting up the embrace.

MITCH
You should speak to the manager and complain.

BILLY
(laughing in spite of himself)
The manager of death? Prolly some sour old white bitch.

They both are able to laugh through the tears.

MITCH
Probably. 
(beat)
If you could have scripted it, how would it have ended?

BILLY
I don’t know.
(wiping away tears)
Something really shameful. Or Scandalous. Something to get all those society friends-of-my-parents, talking about it for years.

MITCH pours some more liquor in both of their paper cups, lifting...

MITCH
May you die in a way that brings scandal to everyone you know.

BILLY
I’ll drink to that.

They drink. 

They kiss. 




= Is max male or female:

MAX
Project onto me the stereotypes you need to. I’ve evolved beyond gender. 
(then)
Another Martini?

MIMI
Yes, please.

BILLY ^
Yes, please.
