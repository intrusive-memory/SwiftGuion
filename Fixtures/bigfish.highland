Title: Big Fish


EDWARD

Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the Chevrolet.
Say hello, Jing.
Only on the surface.  But that’s all I’ve ever seen.
That’s bull-s-h-i-t, that is.  She’s not even a real witch.

SANDRA

EDWARD
But the real story is how I got the car.  You see...
(re: chart)

Don Price squeezes down hard, trying to shit the unshittable.  Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on the tile.
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born.  And if you can’t see that, it’s your failing, not mine.

Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door.  As he leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...
The first thing you have to understand, is that your father never meant to end up here.  And yet he did, twice.  The first time, he was early.  The second time, he was late.
Do you love him?

Young Edward thinks this through.
I don’t have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one.  And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you’re ever going to meet.
I don’t think I’ll ever dry out.
It’s me.  Norther Winslow.

With that, the men start walking down the larger road.  

We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go.  She’s furious, but there’s something more in her feelings for him.  Something softer.
(not hearing)
(he smiles)
True to his word, every month Amos would tell me something new about the woman of my dreams.
It’s bad.

EDWARD
I am always on your side.  And I think you should talk to him.
It’s not like you’re going to lose anything.  You can ask anyone in town.  I’ve been nothing if not generous.  I want the best for everyone.
(no idea)

JOSEPHINE

AT THE CAR

As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see an Oldsmobile parking.
Daffodils?

Fair enough.  Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.

EDWARD

KARL

While Jenny watches, half-annoyed, half-amused, Edward tries to set the door square.  Karl pushes against the side of the house until it fits.

EXT.  THE TOWN OF SPECTRE   - DAY

EDWARD

A beat.  Starting over...

AMOS
Didn’t kill anything, did I?

INT.  BIG-TOP - NIGHT
No, I understand.

> CROSSFADE TO:
You can leave it there.

EDWARD

SANDRA

Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they’re going just a little over the speed limit.  No one’s following them.  It’s an empty country road for miles.

In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself listen to the story one more time.
(low but insistent)

The TELLER WOMAN nods.
(to the crowd)

TEN THOUSAND DAFFODILS.

WILL

Eager to get off this subject...
The Old Lady by the swamp.

JENNY

DR. BENNETT

Will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile-up while his mother checks her list.

MILDRED

INT.  WILL’S BEDROOM - DAY  [FLASHBACK]

JENNY (V.O.)
Mom, do you know who that is?  Blonde hair.

Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him.

EDWARD

Young Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various pulleys and levers to support his weight.  He has a dozen encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.

She cuts him off --

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT 

EDWARD
I’m trying to make a metaphor here.

EDWARD

WILL
It’s more than they thought.  They’re going to stop chemo.

YOUNG WILL

He watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup.
I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.

INT.  BIG TOP CENTER RING - NIGHT
I need to lie down for a bit.

Everyone turns to see who said that.  The crowd parts to reveal none other than Edward Bloom.  Don Price glowers.

EDWARD

Norther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money.

It’s then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.  No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming underwater.  We never see her face.
That really happened?
You don’t like it?

EDWARD

THE LOVELY HOUSE

WILL
Hi, Mom.

EDWARD
Did you see that woman?
He was slipping her a little extra cream.

Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN (50) behind them.  A beat later, an identical face with glasses peers out -- the woman’s twin sister.  
I heard she got it from Gypsies.

WILL

Norther grabs his notebook back.
That’s what she does, she makes soap out of people.

NORTHER WINSLOW
The poet?  What ever happened to him?

His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.

EDWARD (V.O.)

As Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, their backs forming the curves.  

INT.  WILL AND JOSEPHINE’S ROOM - DAY

VARIOUS TOWNFOLK

NORTHER WINSLOW

Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving.  

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

DR. BENNETT

JOSEPHINE

As we watch, Edward’s pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that’s how fast he’s growing.

...where an eight-year old Will is propped up in bed, his face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion.  He’s showing Edward how many bumps there are on his arm.

INT. EDWARD’S CAR - NIGHT - [THE STORM]
Your mom says I can’t tell you that one anymore.  You get nightmares.

EXT.  BLOOM HOUSE - DUSK
I’ll work night and day, and you won’t have to pay me.  You just have to tell me who she is.

VARIOUS H.S. ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS
Dad, I’m about to have a kid of my own here.  It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.

SANDRA
(realizing)

There’s nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might as well be asking for a Budweiser.  Still, Edward senses it would be best to do as he says.  He takes the guard’s gun.
Yes.  Exactly.
We communicated indirectly I guess.  In her letters and Christmas cards, my mother would write for both of them.

A beat.

-- the car is underwater.  The tires are still on the road, but where there used to be air is water.
Did I ever tell you about how...

Amos takes a long look at him.  Ultimately, there’s no way he can say no.  He shrugs.  What the hell.

AT THE PRODUCE SECTION

JENNY (V.O.)(CONT’D)

It’s late, and Edward is pensive. 

SANDRA

Don Price decks him, knocking him down.  Edward gets right back up, but makes no move to defend himself.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Karl thinks a moment.  Then --

EDWARD
Of course, the best part was creating new material.  By the time the twins and I got to Havana, we had a whole new routine worked out for them, with just a ukulele and a harmonica.

SANDRA

SANDRA

SIAMESE TWINS.

EXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT  

EDWARD

Focusing on the final shadow, we...

EDWARD

ON WILL AND SANDRA
This is why you don’t show work in progress.
Whatever he bought, the people were not asked to leave or pay rent or anything.  They were just asked to keep doing as they were doing.  In that way, he could make sure the town would never die.
Sixty.  Eighty.  Four hundred dollars!   Not bad for just the drawers.  Let’s see what you got from the vault.

EDWARD (V.O.)

WILL’S DATE

EDWARD

EDWARD’S PARACHUTE.

While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, Norther Winslow.  It’s Ping who first spots the Chevrolet.

INT.  SHACK - ANOTHER DAY

WILL (V.O.)

Out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra’s cheek.  She wipes it off.

EDWARD
Not that one.  The real story.  Did he ever tell you that?

EDWARD

EDWARD

YOUNG WILL

Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.

No choice, Edward stops the car.  Puts on the handbrake.  Just as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but softly SPLASHING.  The world is close and echoing, because --

WILL

AMOS

The wonder of it.  He goes back to shoveling, a smile on his face.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power.  Wasn’t three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, “Your Grampa is going to die.”  Well, I ran right back to my parents.  My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation.  And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead. 
We’ll have to pick up a copy.

WILL

JOSEPHINE

Edward shakes hands with his new boss, a TOUPEED MAN.  The company is called “Confederated Products.”  The OFFICE LADIES all love Edward.

CLOSE ON the license plates.  Missouri.
It’s Don.  Promise me you won’t hurt him.

EDWARD (V.O.)
You didn’t need to do that.  You just didn’t.
That poet, Norther Winslow did.  He was going to Paris, France.  He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.
Okay.
I’ve told you a thousand facts.  That’s all I do, Will.  I tell stories.

A beat.  A look between them.  With that last job done, there’s no reason for him to be staying any longer.

EDWARD

They hug.  

Edward accepts his diploma.  The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight.

Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons.  Will is approaching with a Newsweek magazine.

EDWARD
Truth is, no one quite knew what was wrong.  Most times, a person grows up gradually.  I found myself in a hurry.

And with that, Edward walks down Main Street.  The townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.  
You’re just trying to get me to leave, aren’t you?  That’s why they sent you here.

NORTHER WINSLOW
No, she was old and probably senile.  Maybe schizophrenic.
Daffodils!

EDWARD
No.

The APPLAUSE dies, replaced by a concerned RUMBLE.  The Emcee yells for the Guards to search.

PING 

AMOS

Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.

JENNY

filters through soft sheets.  We’re under the covers, where a man’s hand traces the curves of a woman’s bare back.   A beat, then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be 
(suddenly interested)
He’s still here.  Let me buy you a drink.  I’ll tell you all about it.  Hell, I’ll have him tell you.
He was buttering her rolls.  Pumping her churn.  Splashing milk in her box.

EDWARD

WILL

EXT.  EDWARD’S CAR - NIGHT 
Were you and my father having an affair?

Edward shakes Amos’s hand before he can retract the offer.  We move into a MONTAGE:

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DUSK

As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake.  Even Edward starts to worry.  Just how big is this guy?  

A beat.  As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward suddenly speaks:

Edward raises his hand.

He finds a quarter, starts to dial.  He has to squint to see through the water in his eyes.   It’s ringing.  And ringing.  The other end answers.

A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby.  Everyone lets out a collective sigh of relief.
Edward Bloom.
You don’t have to.
Hardly two stories in the whole place.  Now I’ve heard in real cities, they’ve got buildings so tall you can’t even see the tops of ‘em.
(interrupting)

WILL
Sure I do.  You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don’t have a plan.  You don’t have a job.  You don’t have anything but the clothes on your back.

Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman?

EDWARD (V.O.)
If that’s what you want, I swear to it.
There’s a fold-up wheelchair in the bathroom.  Wrap a blanket around me.  As soon as we get off this floor, we’ll be in the clear.

PING

EDWARD

The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns.  Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally

A beat.  Does she really mean it?  
Edward, don’t!
Thank you.  I’ll bet you need to --

> CUT TO:

NORTHER WINSLOW

We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching.  Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among the bidders.
Stop.

Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt.  One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.  Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.

We find Will watching them.

ON SANDRA, overwhelmed.  All she can finally think of to say is...
I can’t imagine any place better than here.

Beamen’s daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger.

The door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her 50’s -- the woman from the grocery store.  Her name is Jenny Hill.

INT.  TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)

He decides he better go.

Ping has no idea what’s happening.  Jing reaches into her cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses. 
Will!  I...What are you doing?

JOSEPHINE
Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, it’s with a heavy heart we see you go.  But take with you this Key to the City, and know that any time you want to come back, all our doors are open to you.
Now, I’d tried everything on it:  worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese.  But on that day I had a revelation:  if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn’t going to work.  I would have to use something he truly desired. 

We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.  
No.

Edward wins a blue ribbon for his invention, a machine labelled “Perpetual Motion.”  He and the JUDGE pose for a photograph.  A FLASH.

Wearing a white shirt and tie, YOUNG EDWARD -- still about 10 -- sings “Down to the River My Lord” along with the CONGREGATION.  His voice is high and thin, but he gives it his all.
What did you do?

That’s when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.  
There’s only one I want.

EDWARD (V.O.)
A pleasure.

Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared.  He sees the end approaching, but doesn’t know exactly what’s coming.  Without the story, he’s lost.

EDWARD

Will heads for the bathroom.  Sure enough, the wheelchair is there.
(voice cracking)

WILL

The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds exactly one folding chair.  Nothing else.

JOSEPHINE
Yes.

Will smiles, a memory.  He hasn’t thought about this device in years.  We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the hand.

WILL

reach in and scoop them up.  Their protests continue as they’re carried away, one under each arm.  We still haven’t seen the full stranger.

Without another moment’s hesitation, she kisses him.

EDWARD

The adult DON PRICE arrives.  He’s 230 pounds of football-playing, Skynard-loving, fraternity-proud muscle.  And he’s pissed.
Probably tonight.

SANDRA

EDWARD
Okay.

EDWARD

EDWARD

EDWARD

JOSEPHINE

WILL
This is it?  The whole vault.

EXT.  AT THE GATE - NIGHT  

She’s starting to cry from laughing. 

EDWARD

EXT.  ROAD - DAY
(matter-of-fact)

Norther doesn’t answer.  Just goes back to his notebook.
Wait.  You said I don’t have a plan.  I do.  I’m going to find that girl and marry her and spend the rest of my life with her.  

NORTHER WINSLOW
Yes.  But that’s a different...

WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE.  This is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family.  They should be joyful, but Will is furious.
My girl in the river.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

JENNY

EXT.  BEHIND THE TEMPLETON HOUSE - DAY

KARL

Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate.  He looks to the nurse call button.  He really wants to press it.  
What is it?

A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors being paged.

EXT.  BIG TOP - DAY  

He pulls at his collar.  Then pulls again, his face getting red.  Starting to panic, he loosens his tie.  He’s starting to undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself.  Two more buttons fly off.  One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.
You don’t talk about those things.  Not yet.

It’s morning, and the sun shines brightly.  Birds CHIRP.  Trees drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night’s rain.

Her identical twin is JING, who’s been singing harmony all this time.  They are two separate women who join at the waist, one set of perfect legs beneath them.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY  

> CROSSFADE TO:

He walks away.  We PUSH IN on Edward, enraptured by the concept.

WILL
(amused)

INT.  HOSPITAL RECEPTION - DAY
No Dad, they don’t.  _I_ do not like the story.  Not anymore, not after a _thousand_ _times_.  I know all the punchlines, Dad.  I can tell them as well as you can.

Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun.  Edward throws his rock, but it just bounces off.  The giant didn’t even notice it.

Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him.  There's an effortless intimacy between them.  She can pinpoint what he's feeling before he can.

WILL 

EXT.  SORORITY HOUSE - DAY
How can I convince you to stop?

At the elevators, Sandra and Josephine step out to find Will and Edward barreling straight at them.
You learned from the best.
And the strange thing is, there’s not a sad face to be found.  Everyone’s just so glad to see you, and send you off right.
To the day.

Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together.  He hands them to Josephine.  She throws them up at the powerline.  They loop over.  APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

DON PRICE
It’s good to see you.  You look beautiful.

They shake on it.
Your father decided he needed to have an office, and it wouldn’t do to have it in the house.  You’ll know better than me what’s important.
(beat)

A MAN’S SILHOUETTE 

SANDRA
I wish.

NORTHER WINSLOW

TELLER WOMAN

EDWARD

Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows himself.  Jenny is making soup, laughing at the story he’s telling.
Damn.

JENNY

EXT.  BY THE RIVER - NIGHT

Looking over his shoulder, we see his father’s bed is empty.  The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.

As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the City gets caught.  He’s almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks.  The silver key disappears into the mud.

Edward walks away.  Then starts running.  He has to get there as soon as possible.

Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast.  The room is cozy and drunk.

EDWARD (V.O.)

PING

EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)
Tell your men not to bother us!  And lock that door!

He tries to recollect, but it’s already gone.  Josephine motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed?  He nods.

He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is sitting on the dirt --
How old are you?

DR. BENNETT
That’s because most of it never happened. 

ON HIS SHOES

Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from 

The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed.  The women hug him.  Men shake his hand.

EDWARD

Then a half-blind OLD WOMAN pulls her trigger, hitting him in the shoulder.

A look to say, should I be worried?
What happened to your shoes?

Edward drives, his hand out in the wind.
Really.

A FAT CATFISH

Will waits at reception as Sandra and Josephine come off the elevator.

EXT.  THE SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

INT.  747 / FLYING - NIGHT
The maple tree and the Buick.  We heard it.
Most men in that situation would accept their failure and move on.  But Edward was not like most men.
I have photos from the wedding to show you.  There’s a great one of you and my father.  I had an extra print made.

EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D) 
Tell me how it happens.

This is The Beast.

While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored.  He’s heard this story before.
What the hell are you doing?  This is my girl.  Mine!
During the four weeks I was in the hospital, the postmaster finally caught up with me.

Coming up to the bed --
That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice.

A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years:  BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.
I know.
Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn’t the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?
Down the hall on the right.  The door sticks.  You have to really pull it.

We LEAD Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form.  

Caught, Edward has to confess...
Like this.
Spooning the sherbet.

Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward.

EDWARD

We LOOK OVER to find a nimble Edward sitting up in bed, combing his hair.  
Go.

By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all.  The Key to the City dangles around his neck.  

JENNY

We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage.  He can’t steer.  He’s helpless.  
I see.  I thank you for your time.
This fish, the Beast.  The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.  It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day.
You weren’t alone.

That’s all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him.  He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.

EDWARD

It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it drops at Edward’s feet.  Its tail whips back and forth.

> CROSSFADE TO:
That’s nothing.  I once had to stay in bed for three years.

Patting Will’s shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves.  We STAY ON Will and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and starts making a list.

SANDRA 

INT.  YOUNG EDWARD’S BEDROOM - DAY  

HIS CAR,

Rounding a corner, they nearly crash into Dr. Bennett.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time.  Everyone in town knew him.

Karl the Giant bandages Edward’s arm as well as he can.  Amos is walking past.

WILL

DON PRICE

SANDRA
You’re lucky to get four words out of them in English.  But if you were to walk through the jungle, you’d hear them speaking the most elaborate French.  Those parrots talk about everything:  politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.

WILL (O.S.)

THE KEY TO THE CITY.

INT.  LECTURE HALL - DAY

Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back.   The kid is pretty good, making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a dog.

IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.
I think someone hasn’t.

Edward gives a wry smile.  He walked into that.

Edward looks back at the spooky house.

ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)

A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them.  Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands.
(distracted)
(ignoring)

WILL
It’s only three lines long.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Edward throws the stick again.  The dog takes off in a new direction.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she’s the only one.  
Truly.  I saw it in The Eye.

Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice.  Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage.  Sandra follows him.

EDWARD
How could you miss your cue?  You make me look like a fool, out there alone.

He chases after her.

JENNY (V.O.)

JOSEPHINE

Almost at the door, he stops for a beat.  Gets his breath.  Then goes inside.

JENNY

He stares at himself in the reflection.  He smiles.

WILL

WILBUR FREELY, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a sharecropper.  Redheaded RUTHIE MACKLIN, 8, is happy just to be there.

JENNY

EDWARD

WILL (V.O.)(CONT’D)

Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister.

A beat.

On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to the crowd.

RUTHIE

EXT.  DIRT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

WILL

He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong.  What woke him up?

With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out of the pool, but it’s a fool’s errand.  The pool has long since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, slime covering the cemented rocks.  
My muscles couldn’t keep up with my bones, and my bones couldn’t keep up with my body’s ambition.  So I spent the better part of three years confined to my bed, with the World Book Encyclopedia being my only means of exploration.  I had made it all the way to the “G’s,” hoping to find an answer to my gigantificationism, when I uncovered an article about the common goldfish.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - DAY

EDWARD

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Mr. Calloway!  It’s been a month today.
Did you have chicken pox?

EDWARD
Sometimes in a dream, you’ll visit places that seem instantly familiar, filled with friends you’ve never met.  

WILL

With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.

He smiles, disbelieving.  It’s a real thing.
I was the biggest thing Ashton had ever seen.  Until one day, a stranger arrived.

Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him.  The endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big shadows on the wall.

A beat.

Edward shakes his head unambiguously.  Will already has his finger on the orange “nurse call” button, but doesn’t push it.  

EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

JOSEPHINE

VOICE (O.S.)
How is that possible?  I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it’s another one of his stories.
What the matter, Bloom?  Too scared to fight back?

EDWARD

We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.

EDWARD

EDWARD
Wait!  Edward!
From that moment on, I no longer feared death.  And for that, I was as good as immortal.

AMOS

WILL

Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer.  Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story.  And watching him with deepest affection.

EDWARD (V.O.)
That’s great.

EDWARD

EDWARD

Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth.  Hunched over, he slams into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.

Karl’s eyes narrow, confused.  Edward stands up.

A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold.  Will takes the ring out of his mouth.

She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence.  Edward is breathless.  It’s the first woman he’s seen in her natural state, and he doesn’t dare move lest he frighten her away.
So you can eat me.  The town decided to send a human sacrifice, and I volunteered. 

WILL

EDWARD

EDWARD

Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, exposing Edward’s hiding place.  She GASPS.  Ping turns to look.

As she runs, Jenny ties Edward’s laces together.  Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line -- a perfect throw.  There’s no way he’s ever getting them down.
Friend!

It’s a key.  It’s the Key to the City he lost years ago.
Is that Dr. Bennett’s car?

Finally...
Dad?

Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they SNAP off.  The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.

EXT.  BASEBALL FIELD - DAY  

JENNY (V.O.)

WILL (V.O.)

As the line snakes around through the ropes, the man in front of him gets a look at Edward.

EDWARD

The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel.  We TILT UP to see this man is huge.

The two women start to walk, no hurry.

But then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage.  The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins.  It’s just enough cover for Edward to remain unseen.

EDWARD

EXT.  CEMETERY / ROAD - DAY
You’re a poet.  You oughta be able to.  And maybe if you’d seen more, you could.
Dad?

WILL
(undeterred)

INT.  BLOOM HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
This girl, the love of your life.  Her favorite flower is daffodils.
Water.  I need water.

With the blanket draped over his head like a ghost, Edward points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway.
You shouldn’t have flown.  But...

EDWARD

Will flips to a new page.  The list keeps getting longer.
What does Dr. Bennett say?  Okay.  No, sure, let me talk to him.   I’ll wait.

Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.
(to the Old Woman)

The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring into the mouth of oblivion.  The storeroom is a museum of hasty decisions and half-finished projects:  partially built outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian lawnmowers.  We also find boxes of products Edward used to sell.

She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house.  Hands it to him.  With a look, he thanks her.  Then goes.

EDWARD

SANDRA
(to the cashier)

EDWARD (V.O.)

Edward and Karl keep walking.  The Old Woman shuffles off, somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.

EDWARD
You don’t need a picture.  Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
The one about the witch.

Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town in a tiny valley.

EDWARD

just as it’s about to strike.

The brothers suddenly bolt.  Still standing next to the Old Woman, Edward smiles.

YOUNG EDWARD
Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own?  This lady fish and I, well, we had the same destiny.

EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH

PING

SANDRA

He leans forward and kisses her.  When they separate, she has tears hanging in her eyes.

CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously.  His head is tilted to the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why:  he’s holding it in a MASSIVE LION’s open mouth.  The beast’s sharp teeth are just poking his skin.  If the lion so much as flinches, Edward is dead.

She hands him five dollars out of her pocket.
I brought it.

EDWARD

INT.  BASKETBALL COURT - DAY  

SINGLE SHOTS:  Football hero Edward leads his team to victory.  On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret love:

EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTS

EXT.  MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY

The same stretch of the river where it all began.  A CROWD of more than 100 waiting.  
Daffodils.  

His hunt leads him through the back of a tent, where he’s unwittingly stepped in front of a line of motorized birds.  To the left, CUSTOMERS are shooting with rifles.  He dodges four SHOTS that knock down the birds around him.
It would kill you, huh?
It’s rude to talk about religion.  You never know who you’re going to offend.

As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the welcome spiel in French.  Will has a window seat in coach.  Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.  
Sorry to embarrass you.

Will helps his mother out of a black sedan.  She’s well-composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected.  
And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him.
(interrupting)

Sandra leans over Edward’s broken body.  His head lies on the daffodils.

A smoking Don Price crushes his cigarette as Edward leaves town.
Hello?  Mom?  Dad?

EDWARD

INT.  SANDRA’S BEDROOM - [THE NEXT] MORNING
I promised I wouldn’t.

SANDRA

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - PRE-DAWN  

She pulls open the vault door.

EDWARD

EXT.  JENNY HILL’S HOUSE - DAY TO NIGHT

WILL
You must have taken a shortcut.

Heading back to the house...

JENNY

The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off.  At the last moment, Norther calls out:
While I took the beating of a lifetime, it was Don Price who was ultimately defeated.
Fine, I’m doing it.

JOSEPHINE

INT.  AT THE CHECKOUT - NIGHT

He follows it into the woods.

An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing a lightbulb.  Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls.  Dead.

While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone.  He never even saw her face.

He smiles, remembering something.  On his fourth page, he looks up at his motionless father.   A beat, then we slowly

WILL

EDWARD AND WILL

ON WILL, realizing...

EDWARD

PING

MOVING UP behind the kids, we find ourselves at the gates of...
Truth is, I’ve been thirsty my whole life.  Never really known why.

ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do.  He has a gun, but he truly doesn’t want to shoot Norther.  The Teller Woman is already waving him to the back.

She keeps PLAYING.
The river.
(to Edward)

GIRL

We look around the town, on and off Main Street.   There are “FOR SALE” signs in many of the windows

EDWARD

EDWARD

Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.

EDWARD

QUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates:

Sandra starts to bag string beans.
(realizing)

A beat.

Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE.  The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than expected.  
Well, she...uh...
Well, clearly you don’t.  But I’m not the mystery you’re trying to solve right now.
Son?
Yes.

AMOS
Thirty years.  Maybe more.

AMOS

He passes a sign that reads “Welcome To Spectre!”

A beat.  Don shrugs, fine.  Then proceeds to kick Edward’s ass nine ways to Sunday.
True story.
That’s because we didn’t have a wedding.  Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me.  She was engaged to somebody else.
...there’s no money.  We’re completely bankrupt. 

We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton.  Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions.

Day becomes night.

While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again.  She hands it back to Will.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Would you mind grabbing that?
Please?
(a long beat)

EDWARD
The truth is, I’ve always been a fool.
Wait!  I’m sorry.  Hello?!

WILL

JING

SANDRA

Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy.  He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as Edward approaches.

A typically busy day.  On hold with the phone cradled under an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk.
(in Chinese)

Will won’t commit to Edward’s assessment.
(pointing to a Teller Woman)

AMOS
Not very exciting, is it?  And I suppose if I had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring, I might choose the fancy version.  But that’s just me.

WILL
What were you dreaming about?

He signs an autograph for an ADMIRING CUB SCOUT.

EDWARD

JENNY (V.O.)

WILL
This all happened in the swamp outside of Ashton.  Kids weren’t supposed to go out in the swamp, on account of the snakes and spiders and quicksand that would swallow you up before you could even scream.  But there were five of us out there that night:  Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price Brothers, Don and Zacky.

CLOSE ON Edward, lost in quiet reverie, pondering his latest bit of information.

It’s PING and JING.
When I found this man, he was picking oranges in Florida.  His fellow workers called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow -- because when you were working beside him, he blocked out the daylight.  He could take a whole tree in his hands and shake off the fruit.  I had to pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I could take him with me.
We rented a car.

EDWARD

EXT.  CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY
(closer)
How did you get so many?

The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his.  And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks into The Eye.
Can we talk?
Bloom!

WILL
(to Will)
Those days, your father was working for himself.  If there was one thing you could say about Edward Bloom, it’s that he was a social person, and people took a liking to him.  One night he was returning from three weeks on the road, when he hit a thunderstorm unlike any in his life.

EDWARD (V.O.)

INT.  WILL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)
(shaking his head)

As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos.
It was that night I discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked are simply lonely, and lacking in the social niceties.

Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight.  The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.
I don’t got any batteries!
Logically, you couldn’t be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.

Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a one-street town in the distance.  We pass a rusty sign...

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

EXT.  BLOOM HOUSE [MID/LATE ‘70’S] - DAY  

EXT.  RIVER / UNDERWATER - DAY

Hearing the story, Jing wipes away a tear.  Even Ping is a little affected.
That was my father’s final joke I guess.  A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories.  They live on after him.

He rolls his eyes, why not.

JENNY
I can try, Dad.  If you help.  Just tell me how it starts.

A GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)

EDWARD (V.O.)
-- are in for a surprise.
Honey, it’s still your night.
The truth is, I didn’t see anything of myself in my father, and I don’t think he saw anything of himself in me.  We were like strangers who knew each other very well.

EDWARD
I’m not going to hurt you.
What’s your name, Giant?
Hurry!  We don’t have much time.

JOSEPHINE
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
You mean what you saw in The Eye?
You didn’t become crazy.

Edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other end of the court.  Naturally, he makes it, winning the game.
A new road had brought the outside world to Spectre, and with it, banks, liens and debt.  Almost everywhere you looked, people were bankrupt.  

The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it.  As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.

A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the equivalent of a U.S.O. show.  

A flashlight SWEEPS past.  We are...

A sudden EXPLOSION as Edward is shot...

Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing before her.  She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real.   It is destiny.

She puts her hand to the windshield.  He puts his up to meet hers.  And smiles.
Oh, so you know.

Finally --

Will joins in, laughing.

INT.  WILL’S CAR - DAY / DRIVING
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.

ZACKY

SANDRA

As Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with him.  Karl follows as well.
You’re not trying to run away?

Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange mechanical hand on the desk.  It clamps down automatically.
I will.  I’ll call.

As the ass-whupping continues, we

And like that, it’s done.  We HOLD ON Will, reeling from the news.

Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it’s too late.  A rifle-toting GUARD looks in.
She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.

EDWARD (V.O.)

She’s swimming outside the car.  While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her.

JENNY
We’re still working on that one.

Sandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine.

We follow Will, looking into his and Josephine’s room.  He aims for the guest room at the end of the hall.

Sandra is watering the garden.  Will (5) runs past her to greet Edward, just returned from another trip.
Five-eleven.  One-eighty.  Regulated hypertension.
Really.

Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera.  We STAY WITH Edward in bed.

Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed.  He leans with the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man’s attention.  
Sandra!

EDWARD

AMOS

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Wow.  Wow, you just said it.  I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.

Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs.  They CREAK with every step.
That was the lesson I learned that day, the day my son was born.  

EDWARD

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT  
So what are you up to now?

EXT.  GRADUATION STAGE - DAY  

EDWARD

LITTLE BRAVE

Edward nods.  Yes, that’s what he was trying to say.

DR. BENNETT

As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only teammate who doesn’t mob him.

EXT.  SPECTRE - DAY
(simply)

As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.  The crowd APPLAUDS.

The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive.  The moon hangs low, casting long shadows.  

INT.  BIG TOP - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists. 

WILL

EDWARD
(to the other boys)

Bursting through the doors --
I suspect it will hurt a lot.

EDWARD
Daffodils!

Both women quickly gather plates.  

ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)

NURSE
I’ll help you.
It turned out the savings and loan had already been robbed -- not by armed bandits, but by speculators in Texas real estate.

A beat, then Sandra finally melts.  Josephine holds her.  The two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment be.

WILL (V.O.)

Sitting on the can, Don Price pinches a loaf while reading the new Playboy.

INT.  AL’S COUNTRY - DAY
Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road.

Edward toasts the happy couple.  Josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.

WILL

With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano.  Edward doesn’t recognize her as the little girl who used to have a crush on him.  Without turning, she says...

DR. BENNETT

EDWARD (V.O.)

Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck.  The crowd CHEERS.  And with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go.

EDWARD
(loading film)
Josephine and I have a lot in common.

A beat.  How can she answer?

JOSEPHINE

Embarrassed to admit it...

BACKSTAGE.

> TRANSITION TO:
Beats me.
It’s your mother.

EDWARD

EDWARD 

PING

EDWARD
Any of you got needs?

Will pops the trunk.  Starts to fold up the wheelchair.

The crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river.  As he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.

WILL 

EDWARD

INT.  SCIENCE FAIR - DAY
Fifty-thousand!

EDWARD

It’s a cottonmouth, has to be.  It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.  There’s no decision to be made.  On pure instinct, Edward dives in.  He swims as hard as can, 

Red-headed ZACKY PRICE is 10.  His brother DON PRICE is 12, and a lot bigger than the others.

...out of a giant cannon.
How did you get here?

JOSEPHINE
Of course.
Turn off your flashlights!  She’ll see ‘em.
(calling over)
I’m not going anywhere until you show yourself.  

WILL (ON PHONE)
Glad to see you’re not trying to have a heartfelt talk.  It’s one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can’t hear them.

EDWARD

Will and Edward both smile.  The women clearly want this to happen.  It settles for a beat after they leave.

EDWARD

He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage.  He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up.  Edward looks out at the sea of excited soldiers.  Every one of them would kill him.  He’s the legless cricket left on the anthill.

EDWARD

EDWARD

EXT.  WITCH’S HOUSE / GATE - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]

EDWARD

With Karl the Giant’s help, Edward unloads a brand new door from a pickup truck.  
I thought you weren’t dying.

EDWARD

Will smiles to hear it called that.
You become what you always were.  A very big fish.  
Open a jar.  Open a letter.  Scratch yourself while wearing mittens.  Hold a book.  Hold a baby.  Hold the dog away from kittens.  It’s strong enough, you can do a handstand with no hands at all.
Will.
Ten thousand dollars is no fortune to most men.  But it was enough to buy my wife a proper house with a white picket fence.

DON PRICE

EDWARD
Tell me Karl, have you ever heard of the term  “involuntary servitude?”
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
A man might travel his entire life and never find a place so inviting.  My journey had scarcely begun, and I had arrived.

BEAMEN
I know.  It was the same when I was carrying Will.  Like clockwork.

JENNY

WILL

RINGS THE DOORBELL.

A bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves.
Sometimes, the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring.
I’ll...

VARIOUS SHOTS

Sandra pulls off her engagement ring.  There’s an audible AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from Don’s brothers.

JENNY (V.O.)
I should go to Wall Street.  That’s where all the money is.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Fighting the urge to panic --
GUARD!

INT.  HIGH SCHOOL STAGE - DAY

Everyone turns to look at this new bidder.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.

With a sudden calm...

DON PRICE

EDWARD (V.O.)

SINGLE SHOT:  A lawnmower ROARS along the grass.  We LOOK UP to see who’s pushing it, but it’s not Edward.  It’s one of his teenage EMPLOYEES.

INT.  GUEST ROOM - DUSK
What I mean is, do you really know what’s going on in his head?

EDWARD

A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming.  Edward braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that’s what it’s going to take.
Something like that.

EDWARD

A beat.

A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the end of the hallway.  Will walks towards it, running a hand along the wallpaper.

EDWARD

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - VARIOUS SHOTS
I loved it.  It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it.  I did.  Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me.  A little part of  his soul inside me.  I could feel it.  It was alive and kicking.

EDWARD

Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns.  
There’s leeches in there!

WILL

TELLER WOMAN

ZACKY

The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy.  The sun is still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.

JENNY

INT.  TINY CHURCH - DAY  

EDWARD
Dr. Bennett.  It’s good to see you.

We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood.  Edward kisses his wife.

EXT.  FIELD AT THE SWAMP EDGE - NIGHT

Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it’s a day meant for whistling.  
(yelling)

EDWARD
(a beat)
Tough break.  Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.

JENNY
We swam.  The Atlantic, it’s not that big really.

JOSEPHINE

Will can’t take any more.  Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves.  Edward doesn’t even notice.

And then it gets worse.

Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.

WILL
Over the next hour, I described my love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and the ordeal that brought me before them.  As it had always been, this love was my salvation.  It was destined to be.

> TRANSITION TO:
You never told me how your parents met.

As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes.  A cradle is still in its carton.
There’s a time when a man needs to fight, and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost, that the ship has sailed, and that only a fool would continue.

ON EDWARD, waiting for Will to begin.

He’s talking about his Hand Around the House.  We HOLD ON Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future.

A dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain call.  He’s the star of the show.  Off to the side, we see Don Price is the ass-end of a horse costume.

JENNY (V.O.)

EDWARD

He’s genuinely proud.
Is it true she got a glass eye?

Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, and is about to knock when he notices it’s rocking.  A lot.  Not just that, there’s MOANING coming from inside.

EXT.  AT THE OLD WOMAN’S DOOR - NIGHT

Edward smiles, proud of both of them.   His eyes are so pale and so open, we can almost see his soul.  In every atom of his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom is entirely happy.  

SANDRA
Shit.

Two checkstands over, an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN in her 50’s is getting her change.  Though she’s Sandra’s generation, she carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans and sneakers.

SON

YOUNG EDWARD

The Beast’s journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms.  Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun.  Past a swiping bear claw.  The Beast isn’t worried.

Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet.  The chair nearly crashes into the back wall as the doors close.
Dad!

Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward’s shoes.

INT.  ARMY AIRPLANE - NIGHT

SANDRA
What.  You love this guy?

EDWARD

EDWARD

His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling amusement park ride.

INT.  WILL AND JOSEPHINE’S ROOM - DAY

The road has narrowed to a rough path.  Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air.  Still, Edward WHISTLES.
People aren’t like they are in stories.  They hurt each other without meaning to.  They are kind and unbelievably cruel at the same moment.  Like me, now.  I’m not sure I should have told you any of this.
Hello.
(frustrated)
My wife, Josephine.

KARL

Sandra drops the hose, letting it run on the lawn.

NORTHER WINSLOW

As Edward continues, she can’t help but laugh harder, especially as the metaphors get more vulgar.

A SPINNING PINWHEEL

As the water reaches the third button up on his pajama shirt, Edward suddenly slides 

Will pushes his fingers under his father’s heavy hand, and holds it.  There’s nothing else to do.
Fish looks diff’rent to diff’rent people.  My daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was kid, back from the dead.

He steps on the porch.  The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he continues on.  A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker.  Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.

INT.  THE CAR - NIGHT 
What, a father’s not allowed to talk about his son?

In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY’s jaw drops in awe.  Colossus walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at him.  Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving.  A tight spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd.  

Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.  

EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)

INT.  GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Pretending to be her bitchy sister --  

EDWARD

WILL

WILL 
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?

EDWARD (V.O.)
He was never a wealthy man, but he had made other men rich, and now he asked for their favors.
Dr. Bennett says I’m going to have to be home for a week.
Music!  She likes music.  I like music too!

EDWARD

EDWARD

SHARECROPPER

DR. BENNETT
Yes, Will, I do.  And don’t presume things you don’t know.
Armed with the foreknowledge of my own death, I knew the giant couldn’t kill me.  All the same, I preferred to keep my bones unbroken.
See.  So he was a giant but my grampa was going to fight him because he wasn’t afraid of anything because he’d seen how he was going to die in this old lady’s glass eye...

JENNY

He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to find a matching pair.  Further down, he finds a ribbon tied to 

EDWARD
Who the hell are you?
What?

INTERCUT HALLWAY / BEDROOM
As the months passed, he found more and more things to fix, until the shack no longer resembled itself.

Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place to start.  Then, behind him --

She hands him the ring.  Another beat, then Don storms off.  But not before decking Edward one last time.  
(calling out)
(confused)

Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair.  A beat, then he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.  
I mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about, it could kind of screw you up.  But it could kind of help you, couldn’t it?  Because you’d know that everything else you can survive.

Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path.  He stops.  For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.  The forest is dead quiet.

Her composure is starting to break.
When Norther made his first million dollars, he sent me a check for ten thousand.  I protested, but he said it was my fee as his career advisor.
No.  But it’s weird.  She seemed to recognize me.
You don’t think he looks any worse.

CLOSE ON Edward’s hand as he turns knobs.

Josephine emerges.

The same image of Don’s dead face on the tile is reflected in The Eye.  

WILL

held by a LITTLE BOY.  He’s slumped over his FATHER’s shoulder, being carried towards a big-top tent.  We are...

Suddenly, a deluge descends.  It’s not even rain anymore -- there’s no space between the drops.  It’s like being caught in a waterfall.  It’s that loud.

The first raindrops hit the windshield.  Edward turns on the wipers. 

> CROSSFADE TO:

Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched.  He pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin.
For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom.  It revolves around me and my wife.  How can you not understand that?
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I’m sure he did a lot of things he never talked about.  I’m just trying to reconcile the two.
I knew then that while my days as a criminal were over, Norther’s were just beginning. 
(disbelieving)

SANDRA
We put together an elaborate plan for escape, involving a whaling ship to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a small, dirty canoe to Miami.  We all knew it would be dangerous.

> CUT TO:

At the last moment...
I’m going to get started on dishes.
Well, it’s not a short one.
Dad?

EDWARD

As two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a massive hole punched through the side of a barn.  It’s roughly the shape of man, but no human could be that large.

Amos stops, looks at the young man.  Finally...

INT./EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY  

EXT.  TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY  

DON PRICE

Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN.  Edward is knocked down by a massive black dog, biggest you’ve ever seen.  It has green glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.
Would you say you understand Josephine?

JOSEPHINE.

SANDRA

He leans in and hugs her.  She surrenders, squeezing her son tight.  Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- strong-willed but practical.  They’ve always been close.

WILL (V.O.)

EDWARD

WILL

INT.  AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT
What, you’re seeing down to my nose?  My chin?

Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will’s made it through another file cabinet.  He goes through the folders page by page, but usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash.

Edward is dumbstruck.  With all the strength he can muster...

SANDRA
How I go.

-- Edward gently holds her back.

SANDRA

EDWARD (V.O.)

EDWARD
Jesus, kid.

He looks back the way he came.  It’s tempting to go back.  It would be easier to go back.  But Edward presses on.

JENNY

Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet.

DR. BENNETT

PING

Still wearing his pajamas, Edward climbs into the tub.  Carefully lowers himself.

WILL

The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready for another leap.  Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming the revolver at the dog.

AMOS
I tied my ring to the strongest line they made -- strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.
Dad?
Come on, Will.  Everyone likes that story.

EDWARD
I never knew.
Lucky girl.

EDWARD
I am a footnote in that story.  I am the context for your great adventure.  Which never happened!  Incidentally!  You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.  

JENNY
And what are we supposed to do when we get to America?
It’s a boy.

ANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.

Beamen checks the clipboard.  Not finding the name, he flips forward a few pages.  Still looking...

A long beat.  Another.  Then the SPLASHING water goes silent.  Edward opens one eye.  The other eye.  He sits up to find 
Dad, you’re in no condition to...

EXT.  CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY  

TWO OVERSIZED HANDS

WILL

JENNY (V.O.)

EDWARD (V.O.)
Your momma’s a bitch.

Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his throat.  Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but the creature’s hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold on tight.
Well.  Congratulations.  I’m sorry to have bothered you.

Back to the main subject...

WILL
Really?

WILL (V.O.)

WILL

INT.   BEAMEN’S HOUSE - DAY

SANDRA

WILL
(louder and concerned)

WILL

From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he is.  He seems to fill the Heavens.  With his shaved head and giant club, he seems more ogre than man.   
Will never told you that?
Go out with me.

EDWARD

EDWARD (V.O.)
I am.  And you’re Will.  I’ve seen your picture, that’s how I recognize you.  I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.

EDWARD (V.O.)

He carefully steps through the thorns.  His trouser legs catch on the barbs.  We can hear the fabric TEAR.
I wanted to meet you for the longest time.  I did.
But that’s what kind of story this is.

He leans close to her, whispering in her ear...

WILL

The thrashing continues.   Edward somehow fights his way back to his feet, ready to be knocked down again.

UNDERWATER.

Will sits on the porch with Sandra and Josephine, watching his SON play in the pool with two NEIGHBOR KIDS.

She turns away.  With all the strength she can gather, she hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket.

From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards the crowd.

Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.

FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence.
Have you ever heard a joke so many times you’ve forgotten why it’s funny?  But then you hear it again and suddenly it’s new.  You remember why you loved it in the first place.

He starts to work pulling them off.

EDWARD

JOSEPHINE
My father and I have an advantage.  We never talk.

EDWARD

The family finishes eating breakfast off TV trays set up around the bed.  For his part, Edward is looking better.  Certainly not recovered, but there’s an optimism to his expression.  And for the first time, he’s actually hungry.  
Two different corporations were looking at buying the town, if they could get the price low enough.   One wanted to open a chicken processing plant.  The other, a municipal dump.  Either way, Spectre would be destroyed.

All three stop to listen.
My father’s birth would set the pace for his unlikely life.  No longer than most men’s, but larger.  And as strange as his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all.

But Edward throws back the covers.

She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely horrible for what’s happened.  But eventually she goes back inside.  We hear GIGGLES from inside as her sorority sisters get to the bottom of this.

EXT.  COURT HOUSE - DAY

EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY  
So first he bought the farms.  Then he bought the houses.  Then he bought the stores.

we saw before.  It’s tiny and white, with black shutters and a steep roof.  A white picket fence.  In every detail it is impossibly charming.
You shouldn’t swear.  There’s ladies present.

Entwined, they roll across the dirt.  The other nearby CARNIES scatter for cover.   Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of his clown suit.  Loads a silver bullet.

EDWARD

WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)

SANDRA

EDWARD
There’s a lot you don’t know about me.
So why are you wasting your time in a small town?  You’re a big man.  You should be in the big city.

The Chevy slaloms through the Sunday-morning traffic.

EDWARD

DR. BENNETT
I promise.  Someday.  When I’m really supposed to.

JOSEPHINE

Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she never does.  He stands alone in the river, wondering what tricks his eyes are playing on him.

As the crowd of students APPLAUDS and CHEERS, we CRANE UP above the flowered battlefield.

EDWARD

EDWARD

JOSEPHINE

She comes closer.  Edward holds his ground.  She takes his hand, lifting his hat up to the peg.  She’s very close -- just a half-inch from kissing him when --

FURTHER ALONG

Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the counter.
I’m going with you.
Can I see him?

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

sitting on the edge of the tub.  She doesn’t seem particularly worried -- her husband has always done this.

EDWARD
It’s unbelievable.

Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a quieter moment.

BEAMEN
There was one time when I was eleven...
Edward Bloom!

Edward and Jenny walk back.

Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but not exactly announcing his presence.  The door is open a few inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife.

Will shuts the door to his father’s room behind him.  The walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.

EDWARD
Jesus Christ.

JING

EDWARD

Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it.  Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together.
*But she won’t.*
No, she can’t.
She needs a special **special** different unusual man.
Because that girl,
Who looks like me,
She has wants, but she has needs.
A thousand times.  He caught an uncatchable fish.

_In Chinese, subtitled..._

EDWARD (CONT’D)

Edward turns the knob.

A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns.  Amid the crowd we see Don Price.

Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion.  She struggles to keep it in check.  Almost a whisper...

JENNY (V.O.)
You can’t honestly say you know him.

DON PRICE

EDWARD

Will nods, just curious.  He continues heading up.
I don’t know if you’re aware of this, Josephine, but African parrots, in their native home of the Congo -- they speak only French.
(beat)

JOSEPHINE
(taken aback)

This man is KARL, now 55.  He’s not 12 feet tall, but at least six-eight.

Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket.  It’s Sandra.

WILL

Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped.  The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the trees’ thick canopy.  

Edward winces, but doesn’t say anything yet.  Digging through the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single deposit envelope.  He rips it open, revealing just a little cash inside.  Even some dimes and pennies.

WILL
Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, “Your Aunt is going to die.”  I was so scared I woke up my parents.  They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed.  But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
As it turned out, Sandra was able to keep her same date at the chapel.  Only the groom had changed.
Lord, I’m sorry I...
And so it was no surprise that the Army believed I was dead.

Edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose.  There are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights.  It’s mercifully quiet.

EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE
You stupid sonofa...
You don’t know me, but my name is Edward Bloom and I am in love with you.  I’ve spent the last three years working to find out who you are.  I’ve been shot and stabbed and trampled a few times, had my ribs broken twice, but it’s all worth it to see you here, now, and to finally get to talk to you.  Because I am destined to marry you.  I knew that from the first moment I saw you at the circus.  And I know it now more than ever.
And as brightly as the sun would shine when he was with me, every time he left it disappeared.  I wanted to be as important to him as you were, and I was never going to be.  I was make-believe and his other life, you, were real. 

Sandra and her SISTERS peer out through the curtains.  Is this guy crazy?
Absolutely.  Be good for you to talk to him.

The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely visible over the door.  He shuts it to reveal himself to be 70.
I was drying out.

The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward...

He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it.  There’s a TITTER from the STUDENTS, but he doesn’t notice.
(she trembles)
Fate has a way of circling back on a man, and taking him by surprise.  

EDWARD

TIGHT ON Will, trying to hold back tears as he talks.

JENNY
(a simple fact)
As we get closer to the river, we see everybody’s already there.  And I mean everybody.

EDWARD

Will won’t let him get the last word.
Bob Hope?

WILL

Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching him.

JENNY

With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a dozen other SOLDIERS.  The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook.
Apparently I’ve overlooked this one piece of it, and I’d like to remedy that.  You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.  

Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair himself, pumping both arms.  Will dashes to catch up with him.

EXT.  SCHOOL FIELDS - DAY  
He ate an entire cornfield!

WILL

JENNY (V.O.)

AMOS
Screw.  
No, wait!
Your momma’s a Gypsy.
The River!

WILL

EDWARD

Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the first time:  an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot.  KIDS are playing on the street.
And for that, it was all the riches a man could ever want.

EDWARD (V.O.)
What do you want, Will?  Who do you want me to be?

Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot.

EDWARD
Having a kid changes everything.  I mean, there’s the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Find yourself a nice girl!  Don’t trust anyone in Kentucky!  Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!

EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

JOSEPHINE

Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its ribs covered in dust.  Two beaten metal file cabinets sit beside it.

He controls his breathing, trying to push through it.
You’re right.

He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it.  The stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE’S NEST.  The swarm roars out.
Mine’s Edward.  And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl.  But I want to leave with you.  

Will walks up the front steps.  There’s a subtle change to his expression, a dark cloud lifted.  He unlocks the door.

YOUNG DR. BENNETT

A moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven’t spoken in years.
Edward, thank you for the hand!

Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, facing him.  Her dress is soaked, but she doesn’t mind.

Before he can say anything more...

Edward sits with Norther Winslow.  The fireflies are out.  Thousands of them.
But he won’t.

Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand.  

Given the day he’s had so far, Edward isn’t inclined to follow up on the issue.  He starts to wade back to the bank.

Confused, Will checks the name on the form.
(beat)
Eighteen.

Although we’ve seen him briefly before, this is our first real exposure to GROWN-UP EDWARD, who we’ll follow from roughly the ages of 18 to 30.  

The Old Woman nods.  Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns and leaves.
You’re embarrassing yourself, Dad.  You just don’t see it.

INT.  JENNY’S KITCHEN - DAY

EDWARD

WILL (V.O.)

Sandra stands by the window, watching as...

JENNY (V.O.)

WILBUR FREELY
No time to explain!  Follow us!

ON STAGE

LITTLE GIRL

SANDRA
Within six months, his trust had purchased the entire town.  With one exception.

Edward’s VOICE begins as a memory...
Now, it’s common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch, if only to eat misbehaving children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard.  Witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile.

Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm.  Water is trickling in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly.  For now, he’s fine.

She nods, a bit more of a laugh.
I know it’s not easy.  Just remember, he didn’t choose to be your father and you didn’t choose to be his son.  You just ended up together.  You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it’d be just the same.  If you ask me, it’s a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.

EDWARD

In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister.  Who knows what is lurking in the shadows?

Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive hands.  It’s Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force.

JOSEPHINE
Yourself.  Good, bad, everything.  Just show me who you are for once. 

A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:
He’s impossible.  He won’t eat.   And because he won’t eat, he gets weaker.  And because he’s weaker, he doesn’t want to eat.

INT.  A.P. NEWSROOM (PARIS) - DAY  

We RUSH IN on Don Price.

Edward turns to see 

Will notices the gaze.  The woman turns away.

There are no I.V.’s, no monitors, nothing.
I thought you said you didn’t have a church wedding.

WILL

Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.

INT.  JENNY’S HOUSE - DAY

A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall.  Back down the stairs.

> RETURNING BACK TO:
Get him to drink one of these.  He won’t, but tell him he has to.
Come now.

He turns to see his wife at a payphone.  She hangs up.  She was calling him.
Not yet.
What is “true?”  I’ve never heard my father say a single true thing.  

The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL begins.  A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside.
Stop it.  It’s not funny.  That poor boy.

DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded from coming down the stairs.  He was the town’s first Black physician.  He’s still the town’s best physician.

A long beat.  Then, deadpan...

Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of
And when I’m 38, you’ll be 48.  And that’s not much difference at all.

STUDENT

EXT.  SPECTRE - MAGIC HOUR

ANGLE ON Edward.  Fine.  A hand to wave, enough of you. 

Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top.

EDWARD (V.O.)
What makes you think we’ll help you?  
He’s up with your father.

EXT.  FIELD BY DIRT ROAD - DAY
Let’s get out of here.

Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES.  The bullet catches Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down.

Seeing SECURITY GUARDS heading their way, a quick-thinking Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down.

WILL

HOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER

In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it’s nearly fallen.  He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.
Why, with this product you can...

A beat.  Don stands stunned, his mind reeling.
Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, there was one who was the most feared.  For she had one glass eye, which was said to contain mystical powers.

WILL

EXT.  COUNTY FAIR - DAY  [STORY] 
But I understand you, Mom.  I always have.

With that, he stops.  She regains her composure.
There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn’t.  People didn’t use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted.

JOSEPHINE

We slowly CIRCLE BEHIND a monument, letting it black out the screen.  

EDWARD

MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.

What’s more, all of these people are barefoot.

EDWARD

EDWARD
The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone’s wife.  And I’ve been his wife longer than I’ve been your mother.  You can’t discount that.

He reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has it for him.  She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire glass, thirstier than he imagined.  While he’s drinking, we...
True.  But I’ve known him my whole life, and I don’t feel like I know him at all.  Or ever will.

SANDRA

WARNING!  

INT.  FOYER - DUSK

Edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables you’ve ever seen.  But all he can think about is...
It was during the war.  Your father went missing.  They thought he was dead.

Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses.  He tries to say something, but no words come out.

He wipes them away.

BEAMEN

KARL

He didn’t mean for that to sound so pointed.  Taking the half-empty Ensure, Will gets up to go.  He’s at the door when...

As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out.  Followed by hands.  Shoulders.  Finally, the head.  This is COLOSSUS.

EDWARD

A long beat, then...

ON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors.  He tries to suppress the reaction, put on a brave front.
Please, I need your help.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - NIGHT

It’s not good enough, but it will have to do.  Edward keeps walking.

EDWARD

He walks away.
So I’ve heard.
And so the twins and I began our arduous journey halfway around the world. Unfortunately, there was no way to send a message back to America. 
Hello!

Will can’t believe what he’s reading.

He smiles, his teeth bloody.
I’m not convinced you should be happy.

Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the stick into the woods.  The still-spry dog goes after it.  It’s gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes concerned.

Will lifts his father out of the chair.  

Two fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them.  They BLEAT in panic as 
I won’t have mob violence in this town.  Now, has someone tried talking to him?
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.  

We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack.  Edward KNOCKS on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.

As the performers clear away, the circus’ owner-and-ringmaster AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands.  He may only be four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence.

WILBUR FREELY

EDWARD

JOSEPHINE

> CUT TO:
And the story ended where it began.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I’d like you to go through.  I wouldn’t know what’s important.

Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water’s surface.  Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which disappears into the murky water.  

EDWARD

INT.  BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY
You don’t even know me.
And so Edward Bloom decided to buy the town, in order to save it.
Dad!  Do you want me to get a nurse?
Now.  The thing about working for a circus is you don’t have a regular address, and after three years I had a lot of undelivered mail. 

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

JENNY

JOSEPHINE (O.S.)

> CUT TO:

JUMPING SPIDERS!

Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table.  We LOOK RIGHT, where the “MESSAGE” light blinks on the answering machine.

Will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the crossword puzzle.  A KNOCK as Dr. Bennett enters with his overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.  

EXT.  A CREEPY OLD HOUSE - NIGHT  

EDWARD
(to himself)

SANDRA

Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight.  Josephine is back on the shore, along with the entire crowd.

We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, disappearing.

ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling.

We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.

As ARMED GUARDS search the halls below the stage, Ping and Jing shut the door to their dressing room.  At the closet, they start to change outfits.  Off-stage, their personalities become quite apparent:  Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious, while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish.
Oh.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.

As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find “downtown” has been transformed.  Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold FIDDLERS.
(to Karl)

SON

EDWARD

WILL (V.O.)(CONT’D)

A black car pulls up.  Two ARMY OFFICERS get out.

EDWARD
He’s not going to hurt her, folks, because he’s our own Gentle Giant.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you Colossus!
No way.
Hi.

EDWARD
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.

WILL (V.O.)

As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches.  Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch.  Snakes slither through the marsh.

SHEPHARD

INT.  SHACK - DAY
Or are you too scared?

Norther leans in the driver’s side window.
You’re so sure, why don’t you go in and get that eye?  I heard she keeps it in a box on her nighttable.

A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place.  A spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a snowflake.  Even the elephant is mid-poop.
What can I do?  Can I help?  Can I get you something?  Water?

JOSEPHINE (O.S.)

SANDRA

Sandra looks.  After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again, semi-casually.  Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking, she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.
I don’t know that story, Dad.  You never told me that one.
Karl.

> CUT TO:

With some effort, Will forces up the desktop.  With a HISS, a neighbor’s cat makes a run for it.  Will’s getting used to being startled.

As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward.  He’ll never find that girl, the love of his life.

KARL

Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in earshot.  He then leans in, complicitous.

A ROAR from the soldiers.  She knows what they want.

Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the stairs.  He hears voices coming from the bedroom.

WILL

SANDRA

EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)

EDWARD (V.O.)

INT.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town.
(realizing)
(he points)
Mom?

SANDRA
So what do you say?  Join me?
Don.

A beat.  He looks around, relieved that no one saw that.  He casually walks away.

ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up.  With a resigned shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into the shadows.

NORTHER WINSLOW

EDWARD
There’s a lot of expectation.  I don’t want to disappoint my fans.

The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom.  Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.
Great, great.  That’s fantastic.
William Bloom with the Associated Press if I could just...

The other GIRLS SQUEAL in agreement.  Don Price looks over, glowers.

Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a tunnel of fabric.
But it’s not true.
I told Norther about the vagaries of Texas oil money and its effect on real estate prices, and how lax enforcement of fiduciary process had made savings and loans particularly vulnerable.  Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:

Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie.  He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he’s never left the state.

SANDRA
That would explain the indigestion.

WILL

Scrambling in back, Will finds a liter of Arrowhead.  Hands it off.  Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, he douses himself.  Soaks the blanket.
What’s his name?  Does he talk?  It’s not important.
He’s a monster!

INT.  BIG TOP - NIGHT
You must be Edward Bloom.
I was never much for being at home, Will.  It’s too confining.  And this, here.  Being stuck in bed.  Dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me.
I’ll go in right now and get that eye.

EDWARD

EDWARD

Edward pitches his plan to Norther.
Was she nekkid?

SANDRA

Edward chases a costumed pig, tripping over tent cords, falling in the mud.
You’re pretty good at arithmetic.
I’m sorry.  Have I offended you?

WILL
I saw how I was gonna die.  I was old, and I fell.

Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting for the next punch.  Where is it?  What’s going on?

EDWARD

Jenny runs to him.  She’d tackle him if she could.
Is it the medicine that’s making you thirsty?

He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question.  Of course his father’s not going to be okay.
What do you mean?  You don’t even know me.
He is our poet laureate.
There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he’s made a terrible mistake.  The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.  

INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT
Okay.  It’s morning, and you and I are in the hospital.  I’d fallen asleep in the chair.  I wake up and I see you, and...

> BACK TO:
Am I?

SANDRA
Grab that baby!
So I guess, just, if you could get it over with quick.  Because I’m not much for pain, really.

Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT.  The pain of her shout makes church bells RING.

She shakes her head.

KARL

Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny.  And I met mine.  Almost.

Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.   Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward.  It’s hard to hear over the MUSIC.

He focuses his words on Sandra.  This story is -- and has always been -- about her more than anyone.

Edward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious.

He’s put back on hold.  Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope.  Rips it open.

Five kids walk past in silhouette.  Four have flashlights on.  The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).

Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see 

At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting. 

A beat.
I’m Ping.  She’s Jing.  She’s the good one.

EXT.  ASHTON GAS - DAY

Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates.
Son, I already told you.  You’re early.

EDWARD (CONT’D)

SANDRA

Agreement from the crowd.  And then...

EDWARD

JENNY

Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl’s mouth.  But the giant spits it back out.

DON PRICE

VARIOUS SHOTS:   Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet.  It’s horrible.  Almost unendurable.

Will stops short, the traffic backed up.  He HONKS, trying to get around the jam.  But it’s no use.

He EXITS FRAME, leaving only the sorority house in the background.

EDWARD
Do you know who that is?
Edward, it’s got your deposit slip on it.

BEAMEN
I’m sorry.
I’m going to check on him.
No.  I would say he’s the same.

EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)

Edward continues his narration...

The hospital is so new, it’s not even finished -- thick plastic hangs from exposed framing.  There’s no one at the information desk, so Will forges ahead.

He’s about to toss a file when he stops.  Takes another look. Something doesn’t make sense.
How what happens?

EDWARD (O.S.)

The wall is filled with family photos, happier times.  Most of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding.  As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step.

Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.

AMOS
Will!

A long beat.  Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it.  She’s a tangle of conflicting emotions.
No, but I hear it’s terrible.  Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.

Will quickly debates whether or not to ask her...
You were expecting me?

MILDRED

A fat and happy catfish swims towards us.

Karl shakes his head.

MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...

EXT.  FARM - DAY
Why not religion, Dad?
Promise me you’ll come back.

MILDRED

Taking the bait...
When I’d call, Mom would say that Dad was out driving.  Or swimming in the pool.

As the MUSIC reaches a crescendo, we suddenly...

> CROSSFADE TO:

He brings the catfish up to his face.  Looks it right in the eye.  A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward’s gold ring.
You gotta promise you won’t tell anybody.

Hours later, and the lights are dimmed.  Most of the PASSENGERS are asleep, including Josephine.  Her head is propped against Will’s shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly. 

INT.  BLOOM HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [PRESENT] 

AMOS

A MAN’S VOICE
Leave it!  We won’t need it.

WILL

A VOICE (O.S.)

He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in the tub.  A beat while she considers.
No one would come out here unless they had business.  And no one would have business with me except for you.  You’re buying the town.

After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups.  By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they’re telling stories.  They’re telling Edward’s stories.
Fine, I will.
What did she look like?

That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-in-law.  Seeing the size of her belly --

Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.

SANDRA

The Cashier turns to look.  He can only get a profile as the woman leaves.

INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT  

EDWARD (V.O.)

EDWARD

WILL

Will doesn’t rise to the challenge.  A beat, then he remembers the can of Ensure.  Holds it up.  Edward recoils.
Can I take your picture? 

Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his fated love.  Not finding her, he becomes more frantic, running down the rows.

INT.  AT THE VAULT - DAY 
Friend of yours?  Did you help him out of a bind?

KARL

EDWARD

SOME FARMER
And what I recalled of Sunday School was that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in the end.

WILL
How did you know?

Josephine almost GASPS.  She elbows Will, who turns to look.  From this angle, the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing steps forward.  They’re really two separate people.
You think I’m up for it?

WILL

She smiles, surprised but not doubting.  Will looks over -- what did he say?  Josephine shakes her head.
I had just left Ashton, and was on my way to discover my destiny.  Not knowing what that would be exactly, I explored every opportunity that presented itself.

Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair.  By the tone of the ring, we know we’re not in the U.S. -- it has that insistent European sound.  

AMOS
I hear if you look right at it, you can see how you’re gonna die.

I’d just like to know the true versions of things.  Events.  Stories.  You.
I was wrong about you kid.  You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of.  You could get any girl.

Oh.  Oh.
I’ll do it.

DON PRICE

She moves on to the carrots.

The giant’s voice has such force, it blows Edward’s hair back.
A man sees things differently at different times in his life.  This town didn’t seem the same now that he was older.

I pick you up and you hardly weigh anything.  I can’t explain it.

Unfazed, Don slugs him again.

GRABBING THE SNAKE
How long have you known my father?
I didn’t forget.  I was just working on a tangent.  See, most men, they’ll tell a story straight through, and it won’t be complicated, but it won’t be interesting either.
You --

It’s dawn, and the first golden glow is shining through the vertical blinds. 

EDWARD
Friend!
I want to see pictures of your wedding.  I’ve never seen any.
Is he going to be okay?

Edward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, “Bloom Landscaping.”  He has workers on every lawn.  
Just drink half the can.  I’ll tell her you drank the whole thing.  Everyone wins.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
I’m so glad you’re here.
Really!  That’s wonderful.

A beat.  Not flinching...

EDWARD
Yes?
Good luck, kid.

WILL (V.O.)

This time we don’t cut.  Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he witnesses his death.  He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused.  Whatever he sees, it’s not as dire as the other boys.  His future has something strange in store.

She blinks slowly, just waking up.  Will is watching her.  He’s been up for a while.  We are actually...

The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.
From that moment on, I did everything Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of things he didn’t.  I’d go three days without stopping to eat, and four days without sleeping.

Then he sees the snake.

It’s very early morning, and the first blue light of day is glowing through the vertical blinds.  Still in his chair, Will wakes up a bit at a time.  The notepad is on his lap, the pen in his hand.  

EDWARD
I love every square inch of it.  But I can feel the edges closing in on me.  A man’s life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.

> BACK TO:

Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash bags of papers to throw out.  Looking through a new file, Sandra makes a small sound.  A memory.

MAYOR

JENNY

And this is how he goes.
(a whisper)

He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.

EXT.  BLOOM BACK YARD - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH.  The HACKING escalates until another drink of water gets it under control.  It’s not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from talking.
Hi.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story.  It was incredible.
Never seen her before.  Pretty, though.

JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
Then do it.
But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others. 

Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a metal lava lamp.  Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five fingers and a thumb.  This is the Hand Around the House.(TM)
After that night, I didn’t speak to my father again for three years.  
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.

Finally, a decision is reached.  The door opens to reveal the woman of Edward’s dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton.  She’s effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight.
Bloom like a flower?

A foot suddenly bursts out from within.  GASPS from the crowd.  That foot is massive.  In the stands, Edward looks closer.  Intrigued.

...where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment in an Alabama field.  To the left, we spot Edward, 20-ish, halfway through a bag of peanuts.  He’s still carrying the backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip through Spectre.

JOSEPHINE
Now first, we gotta get you ready for the city.
You know anyone’s who’s taken it?
Welcome to ya.  What’s your name?
I envied you so much.  The way Eddie would talk about you when you were at Missouri, that award you won.  Congratulations, incidentally.  And when you got the job at the A.P., everything, he was so proud of you.  I mean, that’s the thing.  Every moment he loved you.  
What I mean is, will he get back to the way he was when...
Bigger.
People needn’t worry so much.  It’s not my time yet.  This isn’t how I go.

SANDRA

EXT.  THE HYDRA - DAY

SANDRA

JENNY

As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (16) leaving with her family.  She’s wearing a blue dress and hat.  For no good reason, she looks back at Edward.  
What’s the matter with you, kid?  I haven’t seen a customer so depressed since the elephant sat on that farmer’s wife.

Edward carries a dog out of a burning house.

Edward stops dancing.  A beat, then he heads for the edge of the crowd.  Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.

EDWARD
Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We’ll miss you!
True to form, we never talked about our not talking.

A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store to greet Edward.  Friendly but a little drunk, he’s the closest thing the town has to a mayor.  He’s carrying a clipboard.

...where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets, a kind of limbo.  A kiss good morning.  Legs entangling.  Neither wants to get up.
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon.  Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita.  You were born a week early, but there were no complications.  It was a perfect delivery.  Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn’t the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can’t see as it would have been much different had he been there.  And that’s the real story of how you were born.

JOSEPHINE
Look, I just didn’t want you to go empty-handed.  There’s something you should know, Norther.  You see, the reason why...

Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road, no cars coming from either direction.  He looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, along with the rest of the town’s.
Thank you.

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY [REALITY]

As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father--
Trust me, he’ll have to try.

Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor’s unprepared hands.  Bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish.  It shoots up into air.

We DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking his head in the fountain.
There is no softer ground than town.

BEAMEN

Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his entire weight on it.  The crowd APPLAUDS.

Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop.  A beat, then the door handle begins to RATTLE.  It seems to be stuck.
I said this isn’t how I go.  The last part is much more unusual.  Trust me on that.
Your mother was worried we wouldn’t talk again.  And look at us.  We’re talking fine.  We’re storytellers, both of us.  I speak mine out, you write yours down.  Same thing.

NORTHER WINSLOW

After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing.  Relieved to see he’s not licking his chops --
As soon as my bones had settled in their adult configuration, I set upon my plan to make a bigger place for myself in Ashton.
I like your stories.

JENNY
“Unconscionable contract?”

BEAMEN
No.  He won’t.  I’m sorry.

She hands the phone to Will, concerned.
I’m eight.  That means when I’m eighteen, you’ll be 28.  And when I’m 28, you’ll only be 38.  

EDWARD

The CRACK of a bat announces the game-winning home run.  The crowd CHEERS the swing, and especially the batter as he rounds the bases.
I’ve been working on this poem for 12 years.
What about the details?  How they fell in love.  The Circus.  The War.  You never told me any of that.
I followed that fish up-river and down-river for three days and three nights, until I finally had him boxed in.

AMOS

WILL
It’s okay, just leave it.

In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:

Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished.  She turns to face him.  Edward still doesn’t recognize her.
No, I wanted to know.  I’m glad I know. 

And that’s the sad truth.  Karl is less a monster than a freak -- a giant man, but in the end, just a man.
She’ll make soap out of you!

Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back.  He spots Edward walking back into the tent.

EDWARD

INT.  JENNY HILL’S KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

A portable fan quietly WHIRRS in the corner.  Turned low, the RADIO on the nightstand is playing a call-in AM sports show, just a wash of background chatter.  Edward lies asleep on his back.  

WILL (V.O.)
No it’s not.  It’s exactly the same.  Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level.  Just the same as you two.  

JOSEPHINE

The crowd LAUGHS.

EDWARD

JOSEPHINE
The tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup, which attracted the flies, which got stuck to it and flew off with the whole car.

I suppose your grandmother’s house when she passed on.  But we sold that right away.  Your cousin Shirley bought it.

She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes.  We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra.  It’s hard to read her reaction:  does she recognize him, or just find him attractive? 

THE EMPTY LOT

AMOS

Will skips through the stations on the radio, but ultimately turns it off.  He’s trying to think.

Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.

INT.  GUEST ROOM - DAY

KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you’ve ever seen.  Not just tall, but massive.  He’s completely feral, with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered.  What remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy.  God knows what’s living in his matted hair.

Edward shakes Karl’s giant hand.  They hug.

EDWARD

TIGHT ON Edward, enjoying that detail.  He’s focused completely on Will’s story.

Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off.  He rolls to his feet.  

EDWARD
Now let me get this straight.  You’ll buy the swamp from me, but I’ll stay in it.  You’ll own the house, but it’ll still be mine.  I’ll be here, and you’ll come and go as you please to one place or another.  Do I have that right?

JENNY (V.O.)

A classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up.  Written on the projector is “I Love Sandra Templeton.”  She’s horrified and excited at the same time.   The professor finally notices what’s written there.

MAN’S VOICE
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.

SANDRA

At the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade.  She reaches over Edward to switch off the radio.  He stirs from the silence -- he wasn’t fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over him.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
He’s here!

You don’t have to tell him twice.  He’s out the door in a flash.
Soon I added other products, and other cities, until my territory stretched from the coast to western Texas.

Will’s rental car drives past a sign reading, “Ashton, 10 miles.”

She returns with her camera.  Edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain.

A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet.  We have no idea what they’re saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same.
After the war, the sons of Alabama returned home, looking for work.  Each had an advantage over me.  They were alive, while I was -- officially -- deceased.

This town is everything a man could ask for.  And if I were to end up here, I’d consider myself lucky.  But the fact is, I’m not ready to end up anywhere.
You knew that, didn’t you?
In telling the story of my father’s life, it’s impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth.  The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.

JOSEPHINE

Strange to hear it put that way, but --
Over the months, I learned a lot about the woman I was going to marry, but not her name, and not where to find her.  That time had come.  I couldn’t wait any longer.

The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a knife or fork resonating.  Will finally breaks the silence.

Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-open door.  Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can’t see. 

A beat.  Edward steps back INTO FRAME, looking at the sorority house.

Sandra SNAPS the cap back on the syrup.

Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.

He twists and struggles, trying to free himself.  Looking down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the darkness.  They’re already long gone.

We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward’s reflection is caught in the dark water.  As the water ripples past, something changes.  

He leans the door a different way.  It holds for a beat then falls in, SMASHING a small table.
I have to leave.  Tonight.

She puts her hand on the door frame.  On her left ring finger, we see a diamond.
You owe me three-fifty.
What happened?

As Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows.  He checks the number:  33.  This is the house.  It is surrounded by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother’s.  Will notices this.

A half-broken sign lies in the road.  Edward picks it up.  Reads it:

INT.  BLOOM HOUSE - NIGHT  
The only thing that kept me going was the promise of meeting the girl who would be my wife.

The man is none other than...
Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this land?  Some sort of midlife crisis?  Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?
How much time does he have left?

We were part of the same equation.

VARIOUS SHOTS:  Expressive and passionate as always, Edward talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.
Her name is Sandra Templeton.  She’s going to Auburn.  The semester’s almost over, so you better hurry.
You tell lies, Dad.  You tell amusing lies.  Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime.  They’re not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty.  And the thing is, I believed you.  I believed your stories so much longer than I should have.  And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you.  You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined.  Just as charming and just as fake.

No I’m sorry, I...I’m engaged to be married.
You can structure it as a historical trust.  But you’ll need every contiguous piece of property.  It’s all or nothing.
It’s fine.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
I don’t want to be in the swamp with a witch and no flashlight.
My arms are a little stringy, but there’s some good eating on my legs.  I mean, I’d be tempted to eat them myself.

KEYS in the lock.  LAUGHTER in the hallway.  The door swings open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain.  His wife Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.

UNDER THE TABLE

This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion.

The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he’s finished.  The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in.  The Emcee makes a “shoot him in the neck” motion to one of the ARMED GUARDS off-stage.

A LAUGH from the crowd.

Will can’t articulate his anger.  He just leaves.
Yes.  Thank you.

Under a full moon, Edward feeds the animals.  

WILL

As the MUSIC builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook.

The piano starts again.  FOOTSTEPS.

And in the silence that follows, a lot is said.  It wasn’t the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.

Mr. Soggybottom HONKS his horn, then waddles off.

Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the trash.

DR. BENNETT

As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, very pregnant.  She listens carefully to Will’s side of the conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.

JENNY

INT.  BLOOM HOUSE FOYER - DUSK

It’s Amos Calloway.  Will doesn’t recognize him.

Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. Soggybottom.  We also find Edward’s Mother and Father, the Mayor, and many others from along the way.  No one has aged a day since we saw them last.

As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room.  Everyone races after it.
Mmm, what.  I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.

The bank is busy with the lunch-hour crowd.  Taking his place in line, Edward fills out a deposit slip.

It turned out that while my heart belonged to Sandra, the rest of my body belonged to the U.S. Government.

EXT.  HIGH ABOVE THE STAGE - NIGHT
A hitch in the Army was up to three years at that point, and having waited three years just to meet Sandra, I knew I couldn’t survive being away from her that long.  So I took every hazardous assignment I could find, with the hope of getting my time down to less than a year.
He’s almost a stranger and I prefer him to you.
No.  I’ve gotta meet somebody.  I’m already running late.
College!  She’s going to college!
I’m sorry.  It seems every hour I have to...

A gang of his BROTHERS walk behind him.
When did you ever work in an office?

WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD BLOOM, 40’s and handsome, tells the story.  In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction.

A nod, then Will holds the door for Dr. Bennett and Josephine as they leave.  Sandra is alone in the room with her husband.
Do you love your father?

As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother to a seat near the grave.
And every day I gave him a quarter.  Every day.  Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks.  And when I went back there, you know what he said?

JOSEPHINE
But you’re wrong.  I _do_ know you, at least by reputation.  Edward Bloom from Ashton.  See, I’m actually engaged to a boy from Ashton.  Don Price.  He was a few years older than you.
They were squeezing the cheese.  Clanking the bottles.  Licking the popsicle.

Sandra squeezes Will’s hand tightly.  She’s holding herself together, but it’s been a tough day.

SANDRA

WILL
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?

JENNY
It occurred to me then, that perhaps the reason for my growth was that I was intended for larger things.  After all, a giant man can’t have an ordinary-sized life.
Surprise ending.  Wouldn’t want to ruin it for you.
Get it?  “Depressed?”
Probably just as well.  He would have told it wrong anyway.  All the facts and none of the flavor.
I’ll offer you more than it’s worth.  And you know you won’t have to move.  Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.

SANDRA

A little paranoid...

EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)

Amazed, Will turns to his father.

Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles.  He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one’s branches.  He swings off, lands and rolls.  Now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.

WILL (V.O.)

But Edward KNOCKS anyway.
Everyone loves my father.  He’s a very likeable guy.

Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling.

EDWARD
With my prospects few, I took a job as a travelling salesman.  It suited me. If there’s one thing you can say about Edward Bloom, it’s that I am a social person.

The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the porch with their bags.  REVERSE to Will’s mother Sandra (53), surprised and a little annoyed. 
He just fell asleep.  Josephine’s with him.

He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand.  Will pours him a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.

Karl chuckles.

EDWARD
You’re Beamen’s daughter.  Your last name is different.
Zacky, turn your flashlight on!
You married.
I wasn’t old at all.
Yes.

It’s half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no TV.  Will sets his keys on the table.

Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn’t sad to see Edward go.  He crushes his cigarette under his heel.  He wishes he could crush Edward.
By the time I was born, he was already a legend.  He’d taken more hundred-dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who’d drowned in that river 60 years before.   Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period.

Edward nods.  Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the nightstand.  He holds it to his father’s lips, but Edward won’t drink.  He pushes it away.  He wanted something else.

Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out.  But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him. 
Heavens no.  We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
Story of my life.

We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk.  Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more heated.  Both men are a little drunk.

Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer unleashing a new drizzle.  He plays it up, trying to get a reaction out of Josephine.

She’s fighting tears, not the first ones she’s shed over this.

Dr. Bennett smiles as he checks Edward’s chart.

You have to understand.  When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here.  And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else.  With another house, another family.  He leaves us, he goes to them.  Or maybe there is no family.  Maybe he never wanted a family.  But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better.  And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can’t stand this boring place.
And in that way, he becomes immortal.

Suddenly, everything RUSHES.  The crowd becomes a blur, and the young woman is lost in its wake.  Now it’s Edward who’s frozen, helpless in time.

It’s a main street with stores on each side:  Cole’s Pharmacy, Talbot’s Five and Dime, Al’s Country Store.  Everything is old, but this isn’t a ghost town.  In fact, there’s a group of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach.  Most are smiling.  There are even a few tears of joy.
I don’t want to eat you.  I don’t want to eat anybody.  It’s just I get so hungry.  I’m too big.

Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it breaks off in his hands.  It’s not the clean exit he was hoping for.
They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops.  And that’s true.  What they don’t tell you, is that once time starts again, it moves extra fast to catch up.

EDWARD
I guess I’m saying, I’d like to know.
See!  The big guy likes it.

He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.

“Welcome to Spectre.”

Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the spinning arms.  One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the air.

Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra.  Will re-reads the telegram, still bewildered.

With a few breaths, Sandra tries to hold on.  Hold back.

EDWARD
Well, I didn’t know what to do.  But finally I told my father.  And he said not to worry, but I could tell he was rattled.  That next day, he wasn’t himself, always looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head.  Because the crow didn’t tell how it was going to happen, just those words:  your Daddy is going to die.  Well, he went into town early and was gone for a long time.  And when he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day.  He said to my mother, “Good God.  I just had the worst day of my life.”

Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl.  There’s a few tears amid the familiar faces.

Will and his mother pick out one of Edward’s ties, for Will to wear at the funeral.  Will tries to button the cuffs on the shirt he borrowed, but they’re the kind that need links.
You can use it to point out important information.  Or dangers.  Or beautiful women.
That rhymes!

Now, I want all of you to lie down.  I’m gonna be cleaning out the cash drawers, and my associate here is going to handle the vault.

Young Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for the first time.

UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER.  The two men begin to SCUFFLE.  

Edward slips his ring off.

Well, therapy.  And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back.  I was living in a fairy tale.  

His bare foot steps onto asphalt.

We CIRCLE as he shouts:

Edward suddenly drops out of Will’s arms with a SPLASH.  For he’s no longer a man, but rather
(on phone)

Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave.  And then another.  His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, wondering what’s wrong.  Embarrassed, Edward just keeps SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.
Look, I know why you like him.  I know why everyone likes him.  But I need you to tell me I’m not crazy.
How did you know my father?

DON PRICE

ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger.  It’s then we FREEZE FRAME.

EDWARD

He doesn’t let the moment linger with undue sentimentality.  There’s a story to be told.
I am in love with my wife.

Edward stands amid the sea of flowers.  He’s waited there six hours.

KARL

JENNY

The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.  She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him.  Although we’re VERY CLOSE, we can’t hear her voice.

SANDRA

SANDRA

EDWARD
Everything here tastes better.  Even the water is sweet.  Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid.  At night the wind goes through the trees and you’d swear there was a whole symphony out there, playing just for you.

EDWARD

> MATCH CUT TO:
Yeah.

EXT.  TEMPLETON FAMILY HOUSE - DAY

EDWARD (V.O.)
Make him stop.
Look, I’m really sorry.  I just don’t want anybody to get hurt.
So you never bought any land.

He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out of the package.  It’s the mid-1960’s, but by the conservative dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era. 

EDWARD

> TRANSITION TO:
*I’ve had twice the adventure,*
Cried double the tears.
Two times the bad times in half the years.
I need a strong man, because I’ve got
Twice the love to give.

The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone.  She’s as gorgeous a woman as you’ll ever see.

EDWARD

A beat, then Sandra stands.

Edward helps her back inside.  He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him.
How would you describe him?

Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door.  Anything could jump out of them. 

EXT.  HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY

WILL
Because he’s dying.
Then I don’t think so Mr. Bloom.  If nothing is going to change, I’d just as soon it not change in the way it hasn’t been changing all this time.
Is he awake?
Someone stole my backpack.

JOSEPHINE

EDWARD
(aloud)

KARL 

He turns and walks down the front steps. 

Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the water, cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset.  It then dives back under with a SPLASH.

EDWARD (V.O.)

WILL

AMOS
You’re not.
There are some fish that cannot be caught.  It’s not that they’re faster or stronger than other fish.  They’re just touched by something extra.  Call it luck.  Call it grace.  One such fish was The Beast.  

EDWARD 
Son, that creature could crush you without trying.

EXT.  SORORITY HOUSE - DAY
You’re seven months.

WILL
Karl.

She’s dead serious.  Weighing the scales of chivalry, he finally backs away.  Turns and heads back towards his car.

JENNY

EXT.  THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]

WILL
In so many words, yes.

She passes him.  He turns.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
(interrupting)

AMOS

He climbs in his car and starts the engine.

Norther hands him his noteboook.

AMOS
It’s not that, it’s just...

Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside.  Badly.

WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave.  His mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and practicality -- stands with him at the door.

INT.  GUEST ROOM - NIGHT [PRESENT]
He ate my dog!

PING

He points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found.

WILL

Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with a patch over her left eye.  She looks like she’s been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down.
Okay.  Thanks.

DR. BENNETT
I can get you bookings.  I know the biggest man in show business.
Ma’am, my name is Edward Bloom, and there’s some folks’d like to see your eye.

Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of the Ensure himself.  Edward was right.  It tastes horrible.

JENNY
No, it’s logical if you think like your father.  See, to him, there’s only two women:  your mother and everyone else.

EDWARD
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond.  This here is the ocean, and you’re drowning.  Take my advice and go back to Puddleville.  You’ll be happy there.

EXT.  ROAD IN THE SWAMP - DAY

DR. BENNETT
Hey kid!  Your friend just made himself a star.

EDWARD
(impressed)

Will has tears hanging in the corners of his eyes.
What did she say?

He covers the mouthpiece.  Looks over to Josephine.
Somehow, you’re better.  Different.  You’re getting ready to go.  And I say...
I need you on my side.

EXT. CREEPY OLD HOUSE - THE GATE - NIGHT  

It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought.  It’s like he’s only half-there, fighting to hang on to this world.
Okay.  Okay.

Sandra walks out to him.  She’s smiling, confused, joyful and scared.  All down Greek Street, STUDENTS are coming out to see the display.

EDWARD

Don and Zacky both tremble with fear.  The latter has tears in his eyes.
(closer; he holds up his ring)
Look, I don’t know how much you want to know about any of this.  You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it.  Especially this late in the game.
You think this town is too small for you, well, it’s too small for a man of my ambition.  I can’t see staying here a day longer.  

EXT.  SWAMP SHACK ROAD - ANOTHER DAY
Now, Mrs. Bloom, I’ll need you to give me one good push.  On three.  One... 

Will half-smiles.

SANDRA

EDWARD

EDWARD

JOSEPHINE

Edward grimaces, a flash of pain.  Around others, he’s hiding how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.

JENNY

SANDRA
Really.
Fate has a cruel way of circling around on you.  After all this work to leave Ashton, the girl I loved was now engaged to one of its biggest jerks.

INT.  THE VAULT - DAY  

Dr. Bennett has just gone through the details for the third time.
