EDWARD

JOSEPHINE
Then I don’t think so Mr. Bloom.  If nothing is going to change, I’d just as soon it not change in the way it hasn’t been changing all this time.
No it’s not.  It’s exactly the same.  Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level.  Just the same as you two.  

Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward’s shoes.  She races for the door.
So I’ve heard.
I’ll do it.

MILDRED

The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.

WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
When did you ever work in an office?

EDWARD

His determined opponent follows him down.

WILL
Look, I’m really sorry.  I just don’t want anybody to get hurt.

DON PRICE
You never told me how your parents met.
We rented a car.

But one face is missing from the crowd -- Sandra.  Will turns to see she’s already standing in the river beside them.

WILL (V.O.)
Daffodils?
Good to meet you.

Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop.  A beat, then the door handle begins to RATTLE.  It seems to be stuck.

WILL

EXT.  SWAMP SHACK ROAD - ANOTHER DAY

Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place to start.  Then, behind him --

EDWARD

We look around the town, on and off Main Street.   There are “FOR SALE” signs in many of the windows

EDWARD

He passes a sign that reads “Welcome To Spectre!”

INT. EDWARD’S CAR - NIGHT - [THE STORM]

YOUNG EDWARD

The crowd LAUGHS.

INT.  BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)

Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket.  It’s Sandra.

UNDERWATER.

EDWARD

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

She smiles, surprised but not doubting.  Will looks over -- what did he say?  Josephine shakes her head.

EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]

As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the welcome spiel in French.  Will has a window seat in coach.  Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.  

Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with a patch over her left eye.  She looks like she’s been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down.

Scrambling in back, Will finds a liter of Arrowhead.  Hands it off.  Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, he douses himself.  Soaks the blanket.
(disbelieving)

ON SANDRA, overwhelmed.  All she can finally think of to say is...
(she trembles)
And the story ended where it began.
I’ll work night and day, and you won’t have to pay me.  You just have to tell me who she is.
I do.

EDWARD

She moves on to the carrots.

ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger.  It’s then we FREEZE FRAME.

EDWARD

Everyone turns to see who said that.  The crowd parts to reveal none other than Edward Bloom.  Don Price glowers.
Jenny thinks you’re quite a catch.  We all do.

EDWARD
Go back to the start.  Right hand only.

EDWARD
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born.  And if you can’t see that, it’s your failing, not mine.

PING
The Old Lady by the swamp.

TELLER WOMAN

WILL
Shit.

SANDRA

The reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an unearthly glow.  She’s more tranquil and more beautiful than we’ve ever seen her.
But that’s what kind of story this is.

EDWARD

Mr. Soggybottom HONKS his horn, then waddles off.

Edward turns the knob.
They were squeezing the cheese.  Clanking the bottles.  Licking the popsicle.
Dad!  Do you want me to get a nurse?

With Karl the Giant’s help, Edward unloads a brand new door from a pickup truck.  

JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
Wouldn’t lie to you.  And they’ve got all-you-can-eat buffets.  You can eat a lot, can’t you?

JENNY (V.O.)
They got ahead of me.

EXT.  THE TOWN OF SPECTRE   - DAY

Suddenly, a deluge descends.  It’s not even rain anymore -- there’s no space between the drops.  It’s like being caught in a waterfall.  It’s that loud.
(reading)
I tied my ring to the strongest line they made -- strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.

EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

> CROSSFADE TO:

Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop.  It’s quiet, except for the distant SPLASHING of water from the spigot.  Edward’s eyes are closed.
(undeterred)

Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the stairs.  He hears voices coming from the bedroom.

SANDRA

After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups.  By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they’re telling stories.  They’re telling Edward’s stories.

Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him.  There's an effortless intimacy between them.  She can pinpoint what he's feeling before he can.

EDWARD

Will pops the trunk.  Starts to fold up the wheelchair.
I am a footnote in that story.  I am the context for your great adventure.  Which never happened!  Incidentally!  You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.  

SANDRA
But he won’t.

INT.  JENNY HILL’S KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

Amos takes a long look at him.  Ultimately, there’s no way he can say no.  He shrugs.  What the hell.

SANDRA
It’s not like you’re going to lose anything.  You can ask anyone in town.  I’ve been nothing if not generous.  I want the best for everyone.

WILL
Hey!

EDWARD

EDWARD

EDWARD
(to the Old Woman)

The piano starts again.  FOOTSTEPS.
There’s a lot you don’t know about me.

EXT.  BACKYARD - DAY
*But she won’t.*
No, she can’t.
She needs a special **special** different unusual man.
Because that girl,
Who looks like me,
She has wants, but she has needs.

EDWARD
It’s not that, it’s just...
They met at Auburn.

ZACKY
(simply)

EDWARD

Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back into the water with a splash.
They’re your favorite flower.

AMOS

Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN.  Edward is knocked down by a massive black dog, biggest you’ve ever seen.  It has green glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.

She’s starting to cry from laughing. 

Edward shakes his head unambiguously.  Will already has his finger on the orange “nurse call” button, but doesn’t push it.  

EXT.  SHACK - DAY
Will!

KARL
A new road had brought the outside world to Spectre, and with it, banks, liens and debt.  Almost everywhere you looked, people were bankrupt.  

With that, the men start walking down the larger road.  

It’s a main street with stores on each side:  Cole’s Pharmacy, Talbot’s Five and Dime, Al’s Country Store.  Everything is old, but this isn’t a ghost town.  In fact, there’s a group of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach.  Most are smiling.  There are even a few tears of joy.

EDWARD
“Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish will remain small.  With more space, the fish can grow double, triple, or quadruple its size.”

No choice, Edward stops the car.  Puts on the handbrake.  Just as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but softly SPLASHING.  The world is close and echoing, because --

Edward drives, his hand out in the wind.

VARIOUS SHOTS

A long beat.  Another.  Then the SPLASHING water goes silent.  Edward opens one eye.  The other eye.  He sits up to find 
But the real story is how I got the car.  You see...

JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
You don’t think he looks any worse.

We find Will watching them.

INT.  747 / FLYING - NIGHT
(calm and straightforward)

EDWARD (CONT’D)

EDWARD
I’m sorry.
(a long beat)

Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of iced tea between them.

AMOS
I loved it.  It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it.  I did.  Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me.  A little part of  his soul inside me.  I could feel it.  It was alive and kicking.

A long beat.  
Josephine and I have a lot in common.

He chases after her.

The fish passes us with a SPLASH.
I’ll talk to him.  See if I can get him to move on.
(not hearing)
Okay.  Thanks.

She and Will are startled to see each other.

WILL

With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out of the pool, but it’s a fool’s errand.  The pool has long since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, slime covering the cemented rocks.  

PING 
She was a witch.

She pulls open the vault door.

JOSEPHINE

WILBUR FREELY

SANDRA
You didn’t need to do that.  You just didn’t.
My girl in the river.

TITLE OVER:

SANDRA
What’s the matter with you, kid?  I haven’t seen a customer so depressed since the elephant sat on that farmer’s wife.

Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his throat.  Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but the creature’s hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold on tight.

EDWARD

WILL

Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast.  The room is cozy and drunk.

While Jenny watches, half-annoyed, half-amused, Edward tries to set the door square.  Karl pushes against the side of the house until it fits.

He turns to see his wife at a payphone.  She hangs up.  She was calling him.
I can.

EXT.  SPECTRE - DAY

> CROSSFADE TO:

While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored.  He’s heard this story before.

EXT.  EDWARD’S CAR - NIGHT 

What’s more, all of these people are barefoot.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Young Edward thinks this through.

EDWARD (V.O.)

SANDRA 

WILL
Is it the medicine that’s making you thirsty?

DR. BENNETT

WILL (V.O.)

Hours later, and the lights are dimmed.  Most of the PASSENGERS are asleep, including Josephine.  Her head is propped against Will’s shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly. 
Ma’am, my name is Edward Bloom, and there’s some folks’d like to see your eye.
Leave it!  We won’t need it.
(shaking his head)

EDWARD
He’s not going to hurt her, folks, because he’s our own Gentle Giant.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you Colossus!

WILL
Every month you work for me, I’ll tell you one thing about her.  That’s my final offer.

Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion.  She struggles to keep it in check.  Almost a whisper...

JENNY

SANDRA

EXT.  TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY  

SANDRA

MAYOR
What?

Edward and Karl keep walking.  The Old Woman shuffles off, somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.

JENNY
You’re right.

Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water’s surface.  Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which disappears into the murky water.  
(speaking)

WILL

INT.  THE VAULT - DAY  
What about the details?  How they fell in love.  The Circus.  The War.  You never told me any of that.
Screw.  
Stop it!

A beat.  Starting over...

She kisses him.  He tweaks her chin.  The crowd HOLLERS in approval, but their moment remains strangely private.  Only Will is there to witness.

_BIG FISH_
How did you get so many?
(beat)

Entwined, they roll across the dirt.  The other nearby CARNIES scatter for cover.   Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of his clown suit.  Loads a silver bullet.
Cracking the eggs and making an omelet.
What can I do?  Can I help?  Can I get you something?  Water?

We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching.  Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among the bidders.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT 

MAN’S VOICE
Gold.

-- the car is underwater.  The tires are still on the road, but where there used to be air is water.
Soon I added other products, and other cities, until my territory stretched from the coast to western Texas.

EDWARD (V.O.)
Over the next hour, I described my love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and the ordeal that brought me before them.  As it had always been, this love was my salvation.  It was destined to be.

sitting on the edge of the tub.  She doesn’t seem particularly worried -- her husband has always done this.
(interrupting)

EDWARD (O.S.)
No.  I would say he’s the same.
Have you ever heard a joke so many times you’ve forgotten why it’s funny?  But then you hear it again and suddenly it’s new.  You remember why you loved it in the first place.

Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair.  A beat, then he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.  

EXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT  

TIRES SMOKE as the car peals out.
Jesus Christ.
Don’t need to apologize to me.  I mean, I’m the luckiest person you’re going to find today...

The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL begins.  A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside.
Logically, you couldn’t be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.

Edward shakes Amos’s hand before he can retract the offer.  We move into a MONTAGE:

SANDRA
Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this land?  Some sort of midlife crisis?  Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.

As she runs, Jenny ties Edward’s laces together.  Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line -- a perfect throw.  There’s no way he’s ever getting them down.

EDWARD
Son, that creature could crush you without trying.

MILDRED

KARL
Oh.  Oh.

Edward gives a wry smile.  He walked into that.

A beat.  He looks around, relieved that no one saw that.  He casually walks away.
Any of you got needs?

The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds exactly one folding chair.  Nothing else.
No, she was old and probably senile.  Maybe schizophrenic.

As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring.  But it’s stuck.  Finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free with his teeth.

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY  

EDWARD
Get it?  “Depressed?”

Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off.  He rolls to his feet.  

With that, he stops.  She regains her composure.

Edward nods.  Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the nightstand.  He holds it to his father’s lips, but Edward won’t drink.  He pushes it away.  He wanted something else.

Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows himself.  Jenny is making soup, laughing at the story he’s telling.
What happened?

JENNY (V.O.)
So why are you wasting your time in a small town?  You’re a big man.  You should be in the big city.

Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra and Josephine in the middle.  Although Edward has a small plate of food in front of him, he hasn’t touched it.  He’s exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain the family dinner ritual.

EDWARD

Three catfish swim in front of his headlights.
Friend!

EXT.  TRAILER PARK - DAY  

As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in his hands.  Which isn’t a snake at all, but rather a common stick.  And a non-threatening one at that.

Hearing the story, Jing wipes away a tear.  Even Ping is a little affected.
It occurred to me then, that perhaps the reason for my growth was that I was intended for larger things.  After all, a giant man can’t have an ordinary-sized life.

EDWARD
Dad?
Truth is, I’ve been thirsty my whole life.  Never really known why.

And in the silence that follows, a lot is said.  It wasn’t the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.

Will joins in, laughing.

Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back.   The kid is pretty good, making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a dog.

Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more convinced he’s already dead.  But suddenly, he’s back at the gate.

> BACK TO:

WILL

She puts her hand on the door frame.  On her left ring finger, we see a diamond.

A foot suddenly bursts out from within.  GASPS from the crowd.  That foot is massive.  In the stands, Edward looks closer.  Intrigued.

JENNY

INT.  BIG TOP CENTER RING - NIGHT
I really miss that.

He looks at her, puzzled and surprised.  No one has really asked before.
(beat)

Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched.  He pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin.

The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed.  The women hug him.  Men shake his hand.

EDWARD
I said you’re quite a catch!
What did she say?

WILL

INT.  BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY

The soldiers ROAR LOUDER, STOMPING on the bleachers.

EDWARD

TELLER WOMAN
That’s because most of it never happened. 
(whispering)
(ignoring)
Hi, Mom.

A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold.  Will takes the ring out of his mouth.

Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife’s legs.  She’s flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting bedside manner...
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.

Karl chuckles.

The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready for another leap.  Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming the revolver at the dog.

EDWARD

EDWARD

JENNY (V.O.)

JOSEPHINE
Two different corporations were looking at buying the town, if they could get the price low enough.   One wanted to open a chicken processing plant.  The other, a municipal dump.  Either way, Spectre would be destroyed.

Karl smiles, but then it fades.  A certain sad suspicion --

The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a knife or fork resonating.  Will finally breaks the silence.

Edward slips his ring off.

INT.  THE CAR - NIGHT 

EXT.  BASEBALL FIELD - DAY  

Edward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, as much in love as ever.

While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone.  He never even saw her face.

EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)

A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store to greet Edward.  Friendly but a little drunk, he’s the closest thing the town has to a mayor.  He’s carrying a clipboard.
I was drying out.

EDWARD

Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but not exactly announcing his presence.  The door is open a few inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife.

WILL

We slowly CIRCLE BEHIND a monument, letting it black out the screen.  

We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.

DON PRICE

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY [REALITY]
Friend of yours?  Did you help him out of a bind?

SANDRA

As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out.  Followed by hands.  Shoulders.  Finally, the head.  This is COLOSSUS.
No, it’s logical if you think like your father.  See, to him, there’s only two women:  your mother and everyone else.

CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously.  His head is tilted to the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why:  he’s holding it in a MASSIVE LION’s open mouth.  The beast’s sharp teeth are just poking his skin.  If the lion so much as flinches, Edward is dead.

With a few breaths, Sandra tries to hold on.  Hold back.

EDWARD
The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone’s wife.  And I’ve been his wife longer than I’ve been your mother.  You can’t discount that.

WILL 

Still focused on his shoes...
Trust me, he’ll have to try.

Edward stops dancing.  A beat, then he heads for the edge of the crowd.  Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.

EDWARD
Hello.
Your mother was worried we wouldn’t talk again.  And look at us.  We’re talking fine.  We’re storytellers, both of us.  I speak mine out, you write yours down.  Same thing.

The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring into the mouth of oblivion.  The storeroom is a museum of hasty decisions and half-finished projects:  partially built outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian lawnmowers.  We also find boxes of products Edward used to sell.

Backstage, the two men are still fighting.

EDWARD (V.O.)

JOSEPHINE
Turn off your flashlights!  She’ll see ‘em.
What the matter, Bloom?  Too scared to fight back?

He leans in and hugs her.  She surrenders, squeezing her son tight.  Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- strong-willed but practical.  They’ve always been close.

Edward suddenly drops out of Will’s arms with a SPLASH.  For he’s no longer a man, but rather

YOUNG DR. BENNETT

Out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra’s cheek.  She wipes it off.

AMOS

At the last moment...
Spooning the sherbet.
(whispering)
As the months passed, he found more and more things to fix, until the shack no longer resembled itself.
Your father had a stroke.  He’s upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.

Edward raises his hand.

KARL
I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
Your finger?

BEAMEN

The CRACK of a bat announces the game-winning home run.  The crowd CHEERS the swing, and especially the batter as he rounds the bases.

EDWARD (V.O.)

EDWARD
We put together an elaborate plan for escape, involving a whaling ship to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a small, dirty canoe to Miami.  We all knew it would be dangerous.

SANDRA

> TRANSITION TO:

EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)
You get the eye?

TIGHT ON Will, trying to hold back tears as he talks.

EDWARD
No I’m sorry, I...I’m engaged to be married.

From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he is.  He seems to fill the Heavens.  With his shaved head and giant club, he seems more ogre than man.   

WILL

The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy.  Which makes Edward antsier.

JOSEPHINE
Helping people makes me happy.

WILL

Will talks to the ATTENDANT, who points him in a direction, then gestures a series of left, right, left, rights.

EDWARD

EXT.  HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY

JENNY

Will won’t commit to Edward’s assessment.

Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its ribs covered in dust.  Two beaten metal file cabinets sit beside it.

Although we’ve seen him briefly before, this is our first real exposure to GROWN-UP EDWARD, who we’ll follow from roughly the ages of 18 to 30.  
I could be gone for weeks at a time.  But every other Friday, I’d put all the money I’d made into an account set aside for a proper house with a white picket fence.

ON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors.  He tries to suppress the reaction, put on a brave front.

In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY’s jaw drops in awe.  Colossus walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at him.  Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving.  A tight spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd.  
You didn’t become crazy.

EDWARD (V.O.)
Don’t stop.  Don’t.

JENNY
True.  But I’ve known him my whole life, and I don’t feel like I know him at all.  Or ever will.

VARIOUS TOWNFOLK
Wait!  I need those!

Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching the mouth of a cave.  Outside, buzzards squabble over the remains of the giant’s feast:  broken barrels, bones picked clean.

You don’t even know me.

EDWARD
No, wait!

Edward and Karl cut down a tree, letting in a flood of light.  Through the golden pollen hanging in the air, we RISE UP to see the shack is now

EXT.  HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY 

Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she never does.  He stands alone in the river, wondering what tricks his eyes are playing on him.

PING

He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in the tub.  A beat while she considers.
Can we talk?
There was one time when I was eleven...
Absolutely.  Be good for you to talk to him.

Will sits on the porch with Sandra and Josephine, watching his SON play in the pool with two NEIGHBOR KIDS.

Focusing on the final shadow, we...
I brought it.
And we have to take Glenville to avoid all the church traffic, because those damn church people drive too slow.

WILL

EDWARD

Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed.  He leans with the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man’s attention.  

JENNY
From that moment on, I did everything Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of things he didn’t.  I’d go three days without stopping to eat, and four days without sleeping.

A beat, then Sandra finally melts.  Josephine holds her.  The two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment be.
I’m not convinced you should be happy.

With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.

EXT.  CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY

NORTHER WINSLOW

In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:

BEAMEN

We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton.  Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions.

Confused, Will checks the name on the form.
Dad, I’m hoping we can talk about some things while I’m here.
Your father decided he needed to have an office, and it wouldn’t do to have it in the house.  You’ll know better than me what’s important.
*I’ve had twice the adventure,*
Cried double the tears.
Two times the bad times in half the years.
I need a strong man, because I’ve got
Twice the love to give.

A beat.  Don shrugs, fine.  Then proceeds to kick Edward’s ass nine ways to Sunday.

That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-in-law.  Seeing the size of her belly --

We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, disappearing.

The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it.  As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.

EDWARD
I just saw the woman I’m going to marry, I know it.  But then I lost her.

Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES.  The bullet catches Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down.
Can I take your picture? 
The river?
This fish, the Beast.  The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.  It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day.

What’s your name, Giant?

Everyone turns to look at this new bidder.

TIGHT ON Edward, enjoying that detail.  He’s focused completely on Will’s story.
No Dad, they don’t.  _I_ do not like the story.  Not anymore, not after a _thousand_ _times_.  I know all the punchlines, Dad.  I can tell them as well as you can.
Oh.

He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is sitting on the dirt --
Well, therapy.  And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back.  I was living in a fairy tale.  

His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling amusement park ride.

SANDRA
There is no softer ground than town.
I wasn’t old at all.

EDWARD
Why?

EDWARD (V.O.)
Are you Jenny Hill?

EDWARD

With some effort, Will forces up the desktop.  With a HISS, a neighbor’s cat makes a run for it.  Will’s getting used to being startled.

For the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was standing in profile.  Ping is one-half of 
You gotta promise you won’t tell anybody.
Mmm.
Now, it’s common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch, if only to eat misbehaving children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard.  Witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile.

EDWARD (V.O.)

SANDRA

Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight.  Josephine is back on the shore, along with the entire crowd.

As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room.  Everyone races after it.
I have the rest of my life to find out.

AMOS

The carnies GASP.

EDWARD

It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought.  It’s like he’s only half-there, fighting to hang on to this world.

we saw before.  It’s tiny and white, with black shutters and a steep roof.  A white picket fence.  In every detail it is impossibly charming.

He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question.  Of course his father’s not going to be okay.

Will can’t articulate his anger.  He just leaves.

KARL
I spent a week in Morocco for the story.  It was incredible.

JENNY (V.O.)
Now, I’d tried everything on it:  worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese.  But on that day I had a revelation:  if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn’t going to work.  I would have to use something he truly desired.

Will smiles to hear it called that.

EDWARD (V.O.)

A portable fan quietly WHIRRS in the corner.  Turned low, the RADIO on the nightstand is playing a call-in AM sports show, just a wash of background chatter.  Edward lies asleep on his back.  

Will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the crossword puzzle.  A KNOCK as Dr. Bennett enters with his overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.  
I’m sorry.  Have I offended you?
I know it’s not easy.  Just remember, he didn’t choose to be your father and you didn’t choose to be his son.  You just ended up together.  You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it’d be just the same.  If you ask me, it’s a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.

MILDRED

EDWARD
Hello!

EDWARD
There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn’t.  People didn’t use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted.

JENNY
You mean, while _I’m_ here.

INT.  BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY [LATER]

SIAMESE TWINS.

We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically creepy house:  its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie gargoyles half-buried in the dirt.  Even bats are afraid to fly over it.  

JOSEPHINE

You shouldn’t have flown.  But...

MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...

INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY  

From down the street...
Tough break.  Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.

Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of weapon.  He finds only a small stick.  He waves it at the dog, ready to strike it.
You don’t need a picture.  Just look up handsome in the dictionary.

BEAMEN

SINGLE SHOTS:  Football hero Edward leads his team to victory.  On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret love:

The bank is busy with the lunch-hour crowd.  Taking his place in line, Edward fills out a deposit slip.  
There’s leeches in there!
I can get you bookings.  I know the biggest man in show business.

EDWARD
I’m going to get started on dishes.
You were talking about your wedding.

SANDRA
So he said he’d fight the giant who was fifteen feet tall.

...come to find Edward making the shapes. 
Let’s see it.
I ask...
For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom.  It revolves around me and my wife.  How can you not understand that?
But you’re wrong.  I _do_ know you, at least by reputation.  Edward Bloom from Ashton.  See, I’m actually engaged to a boy from Ashton.  Don Price.  He was a few years older than you.

JENNY
The only thing that kept me going was the promise of meeting the girl who would be my wife.

At the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade.  She reaches over Edward to switch off the radio.  He stirs from the silence -- he wasn’t fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over him.

DR. BENNETT

She finally turns to face him.

WILL
(to the cashier)
That rhymes!

There’s no answer.
This town is everything a man could ask for.  And if I were to end up here, I’d consider myself lucky.  But the fact is, I’m not ready to end up anywhere.

Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight.  The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.
I am.  And you’re Will.  I’ve seen your picture, that’s how I recognize you.  I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.

WILL

Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash bags of papers to throw out.  Looking through a new file, Sandra makes a small sound.  A memory.

Her identical twin is JING, who’s been singing harmony all this time.  They are two separate women who join at the waist, one set of perfect legs beneath them.

INT.  EDWARD’S CAR - DAY  
Mmm, what?

In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister.  Who knows what is lurking in the shadows?

As the ass-whupping continues, we

Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the water, cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset.  It then dives back under with a SPLASH.

Bursting through the doors --

A MAN’S VOICE

EDWARD

Like magic, the dog’s whole demeanor changes.  It bounces excitedly, ready to play fetch.

JOSEPHINE
Tell me how it happens.

Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer.  Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story.  And watching him with deepest affection.
What I mean is, will he get back to the way he was when...

SANDRA

INT.  NORTHER WINSLOW’S MANHATTAN - DAY  
We’ll have to pick up a copy.

A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.  
Bloom like a flower?
Edward Bloom!

As the line snakes around through the ropes, the man in front of him gets a look at Edward.

Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching him.

JING
Come now.

JOSEPHINE

EDWARD
Get him to drink one of these.  He won’t, but tell him he has to.

KID

Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him.  The endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big shadows on the wall.

The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch.  When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it shines with a hellish glow.

A long beat, then...

ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling.

Edward chases a costumed pig, tripping over tent cords, falling in the mud.

EDWARD
Glad to see you’re not trying to have a heartfelt talk.  It’s one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can’t hear them.

Edward sees the twins from behind, does a double-take.  It costs him a punch to the jaw.

Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they’re going just a little over the speed limit.  No one’s following them.  It’s an empty country road for miles.

Edward pitches his plan to Norther.

EDWARD

EXT. CREEPY OLD HOUSE - THE GATE - NIGHT  

ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up.  With a resigned shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into the shadows.

His hunt leads him through the back of a tent, where he’s unwittingly stepped in front of a line of motorized birds.  To the left, CUSTOMERS are shooting with rifles.  He dodges four SHOTS that knock down the birds around him.
Hello.

WILL
No, you did exactly what you promised.  You came back.  I was just expecting you sooner.

SANDRA
(introducing)
He is our poet laureate.
My name is Edward Bloom!  I want to talk to you!

JENNY
Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road.
Like this.

Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH.  The HACKING escalates until another drink of water gets it under control.  It’s not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from talking.
What is it?

PING

Norther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money.
Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, there was one who was the most feared.  For she had one glass eye, which was said to contain mystical powers.
Mmm, what.  I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.

INT.  FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [FLASHFORWARD]
It’s good to see you.  You look beautiful.

Grab that baby!

SANDRA
I’m going to spend the rest of my life looking for her.  That or die alone.

SMASHING DOWN THREE CARS.   

He rolls his eyes, why not.
How what happens?
Of course, the best part was creating new material.  By the time the twins and I got to Havana, we had a whole new routine worked out for them, with just a ukulele and a harmonica.

JOSEPHINE

JENNY (V.O.)
We were part of the same equation.

EDWARD
Yes.
And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him.

EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY  
Edward?  Edward Bloom?
Did you see that woman?

Both women quickly gather plates.

Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs.  They CREAK with every step.

Well, clearly you don’t.  But I’m not the mystery you’re trying to solve right now.

The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward...

From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?

EDWARD

Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram.  He shares it with Josephine.
Say hello, Jing.

NORTHER WINSLOW

We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.

He moves his head out from under the sheet.  She follows him to the “outside.”

Sitting on the can, Don Price pinches a loaf while reading the new Playboy.

It’s not flattery.  It’s the truth.

Will has tears hanging in the corners of his eyes.

A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby.  Everyone lets out a collective sigh of relief.
It’s Don.  Promise me you won’t hurt him.

AMOS

It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it drops at Edward’s feet.  Its tail whips back and forth.

Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera.  We STAY WITH Edward in bed.

EDWARD

Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and hangs it on the rack.  Perfect.
No.  He won’t.  I’m sorry.

EDWARD AND WILL
He was never a wealthy man, but he had made other men rich, and now he asked for their favors.
I don’t know if you’re aware of this, Josephine, but African parrots, in their native home of the Congo -- they speak only French.

BEAMEN

SINGLE SHOT:  A lawnmower ROARS along the grass.  We LOOK UP to see who’s pushing it, but it’s not Edward.  It’s one of his teenage EMPLOYEES.

The man is none other than...

JENNY
Bigger.
I don’t think I’ll ever dry out.

Will and Edward both smile.  The women clearly want this to happen.  It settles for a beat after they leave.

The wall is filled with family photos, happier times.  Most of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding.  As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step.

And like that, it’s done.  We HOLD ON Will, reeling from the news.

INT./EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY  

As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father--

All three stop to listen.
I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.  All I knew was I’d been trying to catch that fish since I was a boy no bigger than you.  
Oh.  Here!  Right here.  Edward Bloom.  We weren’t expecting you yet.

Edward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, “Bloom Landscaping.”  He has workers on every lawn.

An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing a lightbulb.  Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls.  Dead.
Where are we headed?

Will won’t let him get the last word.

Recapping earlier football, baseball and basketball highlights, we find Edward beats Don every time.

As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos.

EXT.  BEHIND A TENT - DAY
Hi.  How are you feeling?
How long have you known my father?

Young Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for the first time.

Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons.  Will is approaching with a Newsweek magazine.
Damn.
Sometimes in a dream, you’ll visit places that seem instantly familiar, filled with friends you’ve never met.  
GO AWAY!
I suspect it will hurt a lot.

EDWARD
Listen, Kenny.  Why don’t we skip the lesson today?  We can go again next week.

WILL
It was during the war.  Your father went missing.  They thought he was dead.
Hello Jing.

NORTHER WINSLOW
I hear if you look right at it, you can see how you’re gonna die.
Do you love your father?
All the physical activity had worsened a congenital valve defect.  Put simply, his heart wasn’t strong enough.
Thank you.  I’ll bet you need to --
You become what you always were.  A very big fish.  
My father’s birth would set the pace for his unlikely life.  No longer than most men’s, but larger.  And as strange as his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all.
If that’s what you want, I swear to it.
(realizing)
It was that night I discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked are simply lonely, and lacking in the social niceties.
I have photos from the wedding to show you.  There’s a great one of you and my father.  I had an extra print made.

ON WILL, realizing...

EDWARD

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT  

VARIOUS SHOTS:  Expressive and passionate as always, Edward talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.
Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own?  This lady fish and I, well, we had the same destiny.

Still confused...

EDWARD

He signs an autograph for an ADMIRING CUB SCOUT.
It’s me.  Norther Winslow.

EDWARD

EXT.  TEMPLETON FAMILY HOUSE - DAY

Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will’s made it through another file cabinet.  He goes through the folders page by page, but usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash.
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?

He doesn’t let the moment linger with undue sentimentality.  There’s a story to be told.

A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the end of the hallway.  Will walks towards it, running a hand along the wallpaper.

I’m not going anywhere until you show yourself.  

And with that, Edward walks down Main Street.  The townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.  
That poet, Norther Winslow did.  He was going to Paris, France.  He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.

She hands him five dollars out of her pocket.

Will can’t believe what he’s reading.

The adult DON PRICE arrives.  He’s 230 pounds of football-playing, Skynard-loving, fraternity-proud muscle.  And he’s pissed.
Let me guess.  Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?

Edward throws the stick again.  The dog takes off in a new direction.

Edward grimaces, a flash of pain.  Around others, he’s hiding how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.

WILL
I suppose I should...

Edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose.  There are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights.  It’s mercifully quiet.

JENNY (V.O.)

Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward.

He’s about to toss a file when he stops.  Takes another look. Something doesn’t make sense.

Almost at the door, he stops for a beat.  Gets his breath.  Then goes inside.
Something like that.
I’m not scared.

We RUSH IN on Don Price.

You’re embarrassing yourself, Dad.  You just don’t see it.

A smoking Don Price crushes his cigarette as Edward leaves town.
What’s his name?  Does he talk?  It’s not important.

EDWARD
I was dreaming.
Thirty years.  Maybe more.

INT.  SHACK - DAY  

She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes.  We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra.  It’s hard to read her reaction:  does she recognize him, or just find him attractive? 

Edward sits with Norther Winslow.  The fireflies are out.  Thousands of them.

With the blanket draped over his head like a ghost, Edward points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway.

He controls his breathing, trying to push through it.

He takes his hat off the rack.

Sandra squeezes Will’s hand tightly.  She’s holding herself together, but it’s been a tough day.  
Most of them had never seen Spectre -- they only had Edward’s words to describe it.  That’s all they needed.  He sold them on the dream.  
Really.

As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake.  Even Edward starts to worry.  Just how big is this guy?

Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the stick into the woods.  The still-spry dog goes after it.  It’s gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes concerned.

Edward nods.  Yes, that’s what he was trying to say.

BEAMEN
By the time I was born, he was already a legend.  He’d taken more hundred-dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who’d drowned in that river 60 years before.   Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period.

As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only teammate who doesn’t mob him.

The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence.
Was she nekkid?
And so the twins and I began our arduous journey halfway around the world. Unfortunately, there was no way to send a message back to America. 
Mine’s Edward.  And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl.  But I want to leave with you.  

Will is headed upstairs when his mother comes around the corner with an armful of laundry, including her wet dress.

During the four weeks I was in the hospital, the postmaster finally caught up with me.

Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed.  Although he’s not the vibrant man we’ve seen before, it’s not as bad we feared.  The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.
See.  So he was a giant but my grampa was going to fight him because he wasn’t afraid of anything because he’d seen how he was going to die in this old lady’s glass eye...

You’re lucky to get four words out of them in English.  But if you were to walk through the jungle, you’d hear them speaking the most elaborate French.  Those parrots talk about everything:  politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Not yet.

EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)

EXT.  TOWN - DAY  

Embarrassed to admit it...

A black car pulls up.  Two ARMY OFFICERS get out.
(closer)

WILL
(interrupting)

INT.  HOSPITAL - DAY

There are no I.V.’s, no monitors, nothing.

Will smiles as his son continues the tale, which FADES.  Sandra takes Will’s hand in hers, just listening.
Neither was I.  At first.

Twenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, face mushed in the grout.  Very much dead.
The River!

WILL (V.O.)(CONT’D)

Edward is dumbstruck.  With all the strength he can muster...

AMOS

AMOS

He tries to recollect, but it’s already gone.  Josephine motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed?  He nods.

DR. BENNETT
You’re Beamen’s daughter.  Your last name is different.

SANDRA

WILL

Poor Edward Bloom’s gone crazy.

Norther hands him his noteboook.
Armed with the foreknowledge of my own death, I knew the giant couldn’t kill me.  All the same, I preferred to keep my bones unbroken.

EDWARD

KARL
I won’t tell her if you won’t.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember?  I used to do it a lot.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.

As the MUSIC builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook.
Edward, it’s got your deposit slip on it.
Do you love him?

> RETURNING BACK TO:

Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice.  Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage.  Sandra follows him.
Yes.  Exactly.

JOSEPHINE

EDWARD
I know her uncle.  Friends of the family.

INT.  WOODS - DAWN

She returns with her camera.  Edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain.

WILL 

A beat.  Does she really mean it?  
I don’t suppose one of us could stay with him.  In case he...

As Edward takes notes...

EDWARD

Taking the bait...

A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:

The Beast’s journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms.  Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun.  Past a swiping bear claw.  The Beast isn’t worried.

Edward carries a dog out of a burning house.

EDWARD

EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)

KARL
Is he awake?
Dad!

Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail with help from Sandra.  He rips open an official-looking letter.  Reading it, his face drops.

Coming up to the bed --

WILL (V.O.)

Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.

EXT.  AT THE GATE - NIGHT  

Will stops short, the traffic backed up.  He HONKS, trying to get around the jam.  But it’s no use.
After that night, I didn’t speak to my father again for three years.  

EDWARD
Tell me Karl, have you ever heard of the term  “involuntary servitude?”
This girl, the love of your life.  Her favorite flower is daffodils.

EDWARD
(re: chart)
(realizing)
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I’d like you to go through.  I wouldn’t know what’s important.
No, I wanted to know.  I’m glad I know. 

NORTHER WINSLOW

Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the spinning arms.  One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the air.

Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.
I don’t expect to.
You’re not trying to run away?

You don’t have to tell him twice.  He’s out the door in a flash.

He didn’t mean for that to sound so pointed.  Taking the half-empty Ensure, Will gets up to go.  He’s at the door when...

A beat, then Sandra stands.

As Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, their backs forming the curves.  

Caught, Edward has to confess...

Will doesn’t want to answer yes or no.

EXT.  THE SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the first time:  an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot.  KIDS are playing on the street.

Edward smiles, proud of both of them.   His eyes are so pale and so open, we can almost see his soul.  In every atom of his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom is entirely happy.  
Allo oui?
Don.

EDWARD

Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy.  He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as Edward approaches.

EDWARD
I don’t know that story, Dad.  You never told me that one.

She comes closer.  Edward holds his ground.  She takes his hand, lifting his hat up to the peg.  She’s very close -- just a half-inch from kissing him when --
(beat)

JENNY (V.O.)
Now, I was in a situation.  I could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so I would be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others.  

WILL
There are some fish that cannot be caught.  It’s not that they’re faster or stronger than other fish.  They’re just touched by something extra.  Call it luck.  Call it grace.  One such fish was The Beast.  

MILDRED

INT.  SCIENCE FAIR - DAY
Yeah.
And so it was no surprise that the Army believed I was dead.
You don’t like it?

SANDRA

EDWARD

FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence.

WILL
That was my father’s final joke I guess.  A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories.  They live on after him.

EDWARD

Don and Zacky both tremble with fear.  The latter has tears in his eyes.

Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive hands.  It’s Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force.

INT.  A.P. NEWSROOM (PARIS) - DAY  
Well.  Congratulations.  I’m sorry to have bothered you.

Karl shakes his head.

He walks away.  We PUSH IN on Edward, enraptured by the concept.
I don’t usually remember unless they’re especially portentous.  You know what that word means, portentous?
Five-eleven.  One-eighty.  Regulated hypertension.
You married.

WILL

JOSEPHINE
I’ve been working on this poem for 12 years.

A long beat, both staring at their iced tea.  Jenny is working herself into more of a state by not talking.

Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth.  Hunched over, he slams into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.

Jenny runs to him.  She’d tackle him if she could.

EDWARD

INT.  JENNY’S KITCHEN - DAY

EDWARD

SANDRA

Edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away.

EDWARD

WILL

The thrashing continues.   Edward somehow fights his way back to his feet, ready to be knocked down again.

WILL

And this is how he goes.

Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer unleashing a new drizzle.  He plays it up, trying to get a reaction out of Josephine.

DON PRICE
Who is she?  Where does she live?

AMOS
That’s because we didn’t have a wedding.  Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me.  She was engaged to somebody else.

Will pushes his fingers under his father’s heavy hand, and holds it.  There’s nothing else to do.

-- Edward gently holds her back.
In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
So first he bought the farms.  Then he bought the houses.  Then he bought the stores.

Will can’t take any more.  Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves.  Edward doesn’t even notice.
Why not religion, Dad?

EDWARD (V.O.)
You must have taken a shortcut.

Edward wins a blue ribbon for his invention, a machine labelled “Perpetual Motion.”  He and the JUDGE pose for a photograph.  A FLASH.

JENNY

Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT.  The pain of her shout makes church bells RING.

EDWARD
He just fell asleep.  Josephine’s with him.
What?

EDWARD (V.O.)
Dad?

> CROSSFADE TO:
This all happened in the swamp outside of Ashton.  Kids weren’t supposed to go out in the swamp, on account of the snakes and spiders and quicksand that would swallow you up before you could even scream.  But there were five of us out there that night:  Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price Brothers, Don and Zacky.

ZACKY

Edward leans out the window and waves.  Karl waves back.

A typically busy day.  On hold with the phone cradled under an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk.

He turns and walks down the front steps. 

AMOS

EDWARD

She shakes her head.
(beat)

JENNY
(distracted)
...there’s no money.  We’re completely bankrupt. 

JENNY

KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you’ve ever seen.  Not just tall, but massive.  He’s completely feral, with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered.  What remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy.  God knows what’s living in his matted hair.

EDWARD

JENNY
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.  

While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again.  She hands it back to Will. 
I was never much for being at home, Will.  It’s too confining.  And this, here.  Being stuck in bed.  Dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me.
I’m going to check on him.

The soldiers are SHOUTING for an encore, lighters waving.  The curtain slowly lowers, revealing
Look, I just didn’t want you to go empty-handed.  There’s something you should know, Norther.  You see, the reason why...
You have to understand.  When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here.  And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else.  With another house, another family.  He leaves us, he goes to them.  Or maybe there is no family.  Maybe he never wanted a family.  But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better.  And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can’t stand this boring place.

SANDRA
Is that Dr. Bennett’s car?

INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

JOSEPHINE
What the hell are you doing?  This is my girl.  Mine!

AMOS
Didn’t kill anything, did I?

JOSEPHINE

Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared.  He sees the end approaching, but doesn’t know exactly what’s coming.  Without the story, he’s lost.

EDWARD

WILL

INT.  AL’S COUNTRY - DAY

EDWARD

This is The Beast.

EDWARD

Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the trash.
(matter-of-fact)

EXT.  BEHIND THE TEMPLETON HOUSE - DAY
I love every square inch of it.  But I can feel the edges closing in on me.  A man’s life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.

She passes him.  He turns.

WILL
It turned out that while my heart belonged to Sandra, the rest of my body belonged to the U.S. Government.

Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses.  He tries to say something, but no words come out.

EXT.  RIVER / UNDERWATER - DAY

Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.  
I saw how I was gonna die.  I was old, and I fell.

EXT.  ASHTON RIVER - DAY

WILL (ON PHONE)

She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely horrible for what’s happened.  But eventually she goes back inside.  We hear GIGGLES from inside as her sorority sisters get to the bottom of this.
“Unconscionable contract?”
Daffodils.  

EDWARD
How would his son describe him?
I was 18.  He was 28.  Turns out that was a big difference.
Mom, do you know who that is?  Blonde hair.
But it’s romantic.
Really.

Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun.  Edward throws his rock, but it just bounces off.  The giant didn’t even notice it.
I wanted to meet you for the longest time.  I did.
Promise me you’ll come back.

Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.

WILL

He smiles at his joke.

JOSEPHINE

EDWARD’S PARACHUTE.

Edward continues his narration...

JOSEPHINE
Don!

SANDRA

Will shuts the door to his father’s room behind him.  The walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.
(on phone)

EDWARD
Kid.  Don’t waste your time.  She’s out of your league.

Will heads for the bathroom.  Sure enough, the wheelchair is there.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
(loading film)

Fighting the urge to panic --
No.
I’ll stay.  Why don’t you go home with Josephine and I’ll stay tonight.

Finishing up with AL, Edward shakes hands.
It’s rude to talk about religion.  You never know who you’re going to offend.
I did.  It nearly killed me.

We’re underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.  

INT.  HIGH SCHOOL STAGE - DAY
It’s not a woman, it’s a fish.   No one ever catches her.

Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a tunnel of fabric.
(beat)

WILL
I’m trying to make a metaphor here.

INT.  ARMY AIRPLANE - NIGHT

He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand.  Will pours him a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.

A fat and happy catfish swims towards us.

EDWARD

DON PRICE

The same stretch of the river where it all began.  A CROWD of more than 100 waiting.  
(without pauses)

SANDRA

Nope.
(to Karl)
(beat, gathering)

Tables turned, Will searches for an answer.   He doesn’t have one.

Before he can say anything more...

Sandra looks.  After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again, semi-casually.  Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking, she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.

NORTHER WINSLOW
(a smile)

WILL

KARL

EDWARD

EXT.  DIRT ROAD - DAY 
How did you know my father?

WILL
I need to lie down for a bit.

The APPLAUSE dies, replaced by a concerned RUMBLE.  The Emcee yells for the Guards to search.

EDWARD (V.O.)
But it’s not true.

Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns.  
He’s up with your father.

WILL
Yes, he’s here.
I didn’t know she belonged to anybody.

As Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with him.  Karl follows as well.

EDWARD (CONT’D)

AMOS
I never knew.

WILL

She freezes, stunned and humiliated.  She pulls away.

SANDRA

JENNY (V.O.)

A beat.

BEAMEN

A RIVER.

A dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain call.  He’s the star of the show.  Off to the side, we see Don Price is the ass-end of a horse costume.

Given the day he’s had so far, Edward isn’t inclined to follow up on the issue.  He starts to wade back to the bank.

EDWARD (V.O.)
So what do you say?  Join me?
Mom?

EDWARD

With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a dozen other SOLDIERS.  The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook.

Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself.  A very long, tense beat.  Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.  

WILL (V.O.)
Not a one of us knew what was in store.

The brothers suddenly bolt.  Still standing next to the Old Woman, Edward smiles.

WILL (V.O.)
William Bloom with the Associated Press if I could just...
Stop it.  It’s not funny.  That poor boy.

AMOS
Daffodils!
Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, “Your Aunt is going to die.”  I was so scared I woke up my parents.  They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed.  But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.

Dr. Bennett hangs the chart back on the bed.  

JENNY

SANDRA
There’s a lot of expectation.  I don’t want to disappoint my fans.
I envied you so much.  The way Eddie would talk about you when you were at Missouri, that award you won.  Congratulations, incidentally.  And when you got the job at the A.P., everything, he was so proud of you.  I mean, that’s the thing.  Every moment he loved you.  
Why are you here?

EXT.  THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT
I promise.  Someday.  When I’m really supposed to.

The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy.  The sun is still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.

JENNY
I thought you weren’t dying.

WILL

ON STAGE
I told Norther about the vagaries of Texas oil money and its effect on real estate prices, and how lax enforcement of fiduciary process had made savings and loans particularly vulnerable.  Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:

WILL

Sandra pulls off her engagement ring.  There’s an audible AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from Don’s brothers.

Heading back to the house...
(voice cracking)

She hands the phone to Will, concerned.

Don Price decks him, knocking him down.  Edward gets right back up, but makes no move to defend himself.

EDWARD
You’re so sure, why don’t you go in and get that eye?  I heard she keeps it in a box on her nighttable.
Hurry!  We don’t have much time.
That would explain the indigestion.

EDWARD
I can try, Dad.  If you help.  Just tell me how it starts.

EDWARD 
(to Dr. Bennett)
Whatever he bought, the people were not asked to leave or pay rent or anything.  They were just asked to keep doing as they were doing.  In that way, he could make sure the town would never die.

WILL
Mmm-hmm.  Life’ll do that to you.  And truthfully, the long way _is_ easier, but it’s longer.

**FADE IN:**

Edward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious.

JENNY
After four months, Sandra had gotten over the worst of the nightmares.  When the phone rang, she didn’t think it was somehow me calling her.  When a car drove past, she didn’t get up to check out the window.

Karl thinks a moment.  Then --

SANDRA
Then you shouldn’t have started with a question.  Because people want to answer questions.  You should have started with, “The thing about icebergs is...”

EDWARD (V.O.)

Finally...

EDWARD
And in that way, he becomes immortal.

As his hand moves past the light, we

EXT.  AT THE OLD WOMAN’S DOOR - NIGHT
As we get closer to the river, we see everybody’s already there.  And I mean everybody.

He’s put back on hold.  Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope.  Rips it open.

We LEAD Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form.  
Great, great.  That’s fantastic.

INT.  STABLES - DAY

JOSEPHINE

DR. BENNETT
I won’t be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
(no idea)

A beat.

She’s fighting tears, not the first ones she’s shed over this.

Edward ponders the best response, settling on...

BEAMEN

It’s not good enough, but it will have to do.  Edward keeps walking.

Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it’s a day meant for whistling.  
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time.  Everyone in town knew him.

EDWARD
Go.

Ping has no idea what’s happening.  Jing reaches into her cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses. 

EXT.  TEXAS ROAD - DAY 
What is “true?”  I’ve never heard my father say a single true thing.  

SANDRA

WILL
Hi.

JOSEPHINE

Unfazed, Don slugs him again.
What do you mean?  You don’t even know me.

Edward looks back at the spooky house.

INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates.
Will never told you that?

EDWARD
Don’t.  Don’t be embarrassed.  I should never have let you think that...
That’s okay?

EXT.  ROAD IN THE SWAMP - DAY
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.

MILDRED

EXT.  GRADUATION STAGE - DAY  
Fish looks diff’rent to diff’rent people.  My daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was kid, back from the dead.

Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see 

KARL
Yes?

WILL
A hitch in the Army was up to three years at that point, and having waited three years just to meet Sandra, I knew I couldn’t survive being away from her that long.  So I took every hazardous assignment I could find, with the hope of getting my time down to less than a year.

EDWARD

> CUT TO BLACK.

> COME TO:
I don’t believe it!

Edward helps her back inside.  He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him.

Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. Soggybottom.  We also find Edward’s Mother and Father, the Mayor, and many others from along the way.  No one has aged a day since we saw them last.

WILL (V.O.)(CONT’D)

EDWARD (V.O.)

EDWARD (V.O.)

Edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables you’ve ever seen.  But all he can think about is...
That’s terrible.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?

EDWARD
Was she one of your teachers?

EDWARD

JENNY

EDWARD

JOSEPHINE

VARIOUS SHOTS:   Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet.  It’s horrible.  Almost unendurable.

EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH

A beat.  Not flinching...
I said this isn’t how I go.  The last part is much more unusual.  Trust me on that.

Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra.  Will re-reads the telegram, still bewildered.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Norther leans in the driver’s side window.

Off her silence...
I will never marry you.
How is he?

That’s all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him.  He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.
It’s your mother.

Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped.  The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the trees’ thick canopy.

Much longer.

Edward accepts his diploma.  The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight.

A MAN’S SILHOUETTE 
Okay.

Will quickly debates whether or not to ask her...

The JUMP LEADER yells...
You --

_**THE END**_

A flashlight SWEEPS past.  We are...

NORTHER WINSLOW

EDWARD

While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, Norther Winslow.  It’s Ping who first spots the Chevrolet.
We communicated indirectly I guess.  In her letters and Christmas cards, my mother would write for both of them.
Fate has a cruel way of circling around on you.  After all this work to leave Ashton, the girl I loved was now engaged to one of its biggest jerks.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny.  And I met mine.  Almost.

WILL
I see.  I thank you for your time.

WILL
It’s only three lines long.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY  
So you can eat me.  The town decided to send a human sacrifice, and I volunteered. 
And as brightly as the sun would shine when he was with me, every time he left it disappeared.  I wanted to be as important to him as you were, and I was never going to be.  I was make-believe and his other life, you, were real. 

And then it gets worse.

The road has narrowed to a rough path.  Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air.  Still, Edward WHISTLES.

WILL

Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of the Ensure himself.  Edward was right.  It tastes horrible.

Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange mechanical hand on the desk.  It clamps down automatically.

As ARMED GUARDS search the halls below the stage, Ping and Jing shut the door to their dressing room.  At the closet, they start to change outfits.  Off-stage, their personalities become quite apparent:  Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious, while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish.

NORTHER WINSLOW

WILL

A beat.  Don stands stunned, his mind reeling.

SANDRA

MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.

Half-stripped, Will takes the phone.  This won’t be good news.
Sure I do.  You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don’t have a plan.  You don’t have a job.  You don’t have anything but the clothes on your back.
Or are you too scared?
Faster!
I was wrong about you kid.  You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of.  You could get any girl.
Probably just as well.  He would have told it wrong anyway.  All the facts and none of the flavor.

WILL
I am in love with my wife.
It’s fine.

WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE.  This is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family.  They should be joyful, but Will is furious.

This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion.

Shoot.

on the sheet in front of her.  She freezes, watching the shadow ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the breeze.  She knows it can’t be him.  He’s dead.

EDWARD

WILL
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them.  The other 90 percent is below the water where you can’t see it.  And that’s what it is with you Dad.  I’m only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.

JUMP LEADER
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes.  There was a whole life out there that I was not living.  So I travelled.  I saw France, and Africa, half of South America.  Every day a new adventure, that’s my motto.
(he points)

EXT.  FIELD AT THE SWAMP EDGE - NIGHT
I was thinking about death and all.  About seeing how you’re gonna die.

PING

INT.  BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

He EXITS FRAME, leaving only the sorority house in the background.

INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
(to himself)
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power.  Wasn’t three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, “Your Grampa is going to die.”  Well, I ran right back to my parents.  My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation.  And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead. 
A thousand times.  He caught an uncatchable fish.

A bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves.
No.  But it’s weird.  She seemed to recognize me.

Norther grabs his notebook back.

ANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.

Karl’s eyes narrow, confused.  Edward stands up.

The PIANO STUDENT, a black boy of eight, has stopped.  He’s watching the conversation at the door.  Speaking of awkward...

The trees ahead are moving.  At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood CRACKING and GROANING, there’s no mistaking it:  they’re trying to block him.

Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path.  He stops.  For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.  The forest is dead quiet.
Were you and my father having an affair?

INT.  WILL’S BEDROOM - DAY  [FLASHBACK]

Will smiles, a memory.  He hasn’t thought about this device in years.  We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the hand.

_In Chinese, subtitled..._
I should go to Wall Street.  That’s where all the money is.
Look, I know why you like him.  I know why everyone likes him.  But I need you to tell me I’m not crazy.

Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting for the next punch.  Where is it?  What’s going on?
He’s impossible.  He won’t eat.   And because he won’t eat, he gets weaker.  And because he’s weaker, he doesn’t want to eat.

INT.  HOSPITAL RECEPTION - DAY

They pass a HEAVYSET NURSE, who turns to look.

SANDRA

In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it’s nearly fallen.  He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.

Will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile-up while his mother checks her list.

In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself listen to the story one more time.
And you’re here now, and that’s what matters.
I was the biggest thing Ashton had ever seen.  Until one day, a stranger arrived.

He starts to work pulling them off.

She turns away.  With all the strength she can gather, she hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket.
Okay.
Did you and Dad have any other property?

EDWARD
GO!  GO!  GO!

EDWARD
-- are in for a surprise.

The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive.  The moon hangs low, casting long shadows.  

The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.
He’s here!

At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich.

EDWARD (V.O.)

As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (16) leaving with her family.  She’s wearing a blue dress and hat.  For no good reason, she looks back at Edward.  
Daffodils!

He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.

DR. BENNETT

Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from the restrooms.  She looks gorgeous.  She couldn’t be any happier if this were her own wedding.

EDWARD

NORTHER WINSLOW

Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles.  He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one’s branches.  He swings off, lands and rolls.  Now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.

He looks back the way he came.  It’s tempting to go back.  It would be easier to go back.  But Edward presses on.

JENNY

...where an eight-year old Will is propped up in bed, his face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion.  He’s showing Edward how many bumps there are on his arm.

Edward’s VOICE begins as a memory...

PING

Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in.

WILL

Will waits at reception as Sandra and Josephine come off the elevator.
(on phone)
I’ve got a whole backpack _full_ of clothes!
I’ll go in right now and get that eye.

Rounding a corner, they nearly crash into Dr. Bennett.
There’s only one I want.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?

Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate.  He looks to the nurse call button.  He really wants to press it.  
I know.
(to Will)

We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack.  Edward KNOCKS on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.

AT THE PRODUCE SECTION
Within six months, his trust had purchased the entire town.  With one exception.

Beamen’s daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger.

EXT.  FARM - DAY

EXT.  PATH BACK TO TOWN - NIGHT

Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing before her.  She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real.   It is destiny.

EDWARD

SANDRA
(joking)

One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main line.  When his time comes, Edward leaps...
That’s great, Norther.  I’m happy for you.  I can’t believe I helped.

WILL

Five kids walk past in silhouette.  Four have flashlights on.  The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).

EDWARD

The crowd CHEERS.  The Ashton marching band PLAYS.  Jenny Hill smiles.  So does the Old Woman.

WILL (V.O.)
There’s a time when a man needs to fight, and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost, that the ship has sailed, and that only a fool would continue.

The two make eye contact.  And as they do, all motion FREEZES.  

The wonder of it.  He goes back to shoveling, a smile on his face.

EDWARD
Not that one.  The real story.  Did he ever tell you that?

Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it breaks off in his hands.  It’s not the clean exit he was hoping for.

EDWARD
Do you know who that is?

WILL
This is why you don’t show work in progress.
My arms are a little stringy, but there’s some good eating on my legs.  I mean, I’d be tempted to eat them myself.
You knew that, didn’t you?

EDWARD (V.O.)

He carefully steps through the thorns.  His trouser legs catch on the barbs.  We can hear the fabric TEAR.
(taken aback)

YOUNG WILL

EDWARD (V.O.)
How could you miss your cue?  You make me look like a fool, out there alone.

EDWARD (V.O.)
You’re not.
What.  You love this guy?
How much time does he have left?

INT.  GUEST ROOM - DAY
Hi.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

He points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found.

DR. BENNETT

A beat.

EDWARD

ON EDWARD, waiting for Will to begin.

EDWARD
You’ll call if...

INT.  SHACK - DAY

Sandra starts to bag string beans.
No one’s ever left.  
What is this place?

As two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a massive hole punched through the side of a barn.  It’s roughly the shape of man, but no human could be that large.

Edward and Jenny walk back.

Without another moment’s hesitation, she kisses him.
Now first, we gotta get you ready for the city.
(thinking)
I saw my death in that eye.  And this is not how it happens.
What, you’re seeing down to my nose?  My chin?

...but he’s stuck.  His cord is caught up in the assembly.
Am I?

He’s genuinely proud.

EDWARD
I mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about, it could kind of screw you up.  But it could kind of help you, couldn’t it?  Because you’d know that everything else you can survive.

We PUSH IN on the Old Woman’s glass eye, where we see...
When I’d call, Mom would say that Dad was out driving.  Or swimming in the pool.

A beat.  Edward steps back INTO FRAME, looking at the sorority house.

A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place.  A spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a snowflake.  Even the elephant is mid-poop.

EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D)
For the next couple weeks, I didn’t have another dream.  Until one night the crow came back and said, “Your Daddy is going to die.”  

WILL

Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.

The Cashier turns to look.  He can only get a profile as the woman leaves.

> CUT TO:

EDWARD

Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm.  Water is trickling in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly.  For now, he’s fine.
(beat)
As difficult as it was to reach Spectre, I was fated to get there eventually.  After all, no man can avoid reaching the end of his life.

FURTHER ALONG 
Wow.  Wow, you just said it.  I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Dr. Bennett says I’m going to have to be home for a week.
After the war, the sons of Alabama returned home, looking for work.  Each had an advantage over me.  They were alive, while I was -- officially -- deceased.

JING
I knew then that while my days as a criminal were over, Norther’s were just beginning.

SANDRA

SANDRA

Josephine opens the curtains, letting white sunlight in.  She strips the bed.

As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, very pregnant.  She listens carefully to Will’s side of the conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.

EDWARD
Then do it.
Will!  I...What are you doing?

AMOS
Well, it’s not a short one.

WILL 
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she’s the only one.

The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.

YOUNG EDWARD

Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and closer to this woman.
True to his word, every month Amos would tell me something new about the woman of my dreams.

(suddenly interested)

Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they SNAP off.  The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.

CASHIER

The giant’s voice has such force, it blows Edward’s hair back.

INT.  WILL’S CAR - DAY / DRIVING
So I guess, just, if you could get it over with quick.  Because I’m not much for pain, really.

That’s when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.  

As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the City gets caught.  He’s almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks.  The silver key disappears into the mud.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?

A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them.  Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands.

EDWARD

INT.  DOWNTOWN OFFICE - DAY [STORY]
You weren’t alone.

The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off.  At the last moment, Norther calls out:
I need you on my side.
He’s almost a stranger and I prefer him to you.
You don’t talk about those things.  Not yet.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

WILL
(realizing)

EDWARD

Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair himself, pumping both arms.  Will dashes to catch up with him.
Her name is Sandra Templeton.  She’s going to Auburn.  The semester’s almost over, so you better hurry.

A devilish smile.  Pushing past Edward, we settle on the whirling fan.
Okay.  It’s morning, and you and I are in the hospital.  I’d fallen asleep in the chair.  I wake up and I see you, and...

JENNY
I will.  I’ll call.

With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano.  Edward doesn’t recognize her as the little girl who used to have a crush on him.  Without turning, she says...
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Now, I want all of you to lie down.  I’m gonna be cleaning out the cash drawers, and my associate here is going to handle the vault.
The town of Spectre.  Best kept secret in Alabama.   Says here you’re from Ashton, right?  Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

Two fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them.  They BLEAT in panic as 
How old are you?

IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.

WILL
So how does it happen?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.

Digging a knife out of his pocket, Edward gets to work cutting through the cable.  It finally POPS.  Edward jumps from the plane.
Having a kid changes everything.  I mean, there’s the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
So what are you up to now?

WILL (V.O.)
The truth is, I’ve always been a fool.

EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT’D) 

INT.  A DARK PLACE - NIGHT  
Well, I didn’t know what to do.  But finally I told my father.  And he said not to worry, but I could tell he was rattled.  That next day, he wasn’t himself, always looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head.  Because the crow didn’t tell how it was going to happen, just those words:  your Daddy is going to die.  Well, he went into town early and was gone for a long time.  And when he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day.  He said to my mother, “Good God.  I just had the worst day of my life.”
No.

EDWARD
Never seen her before.  Pretty, though.

Will skips through the stations on the radio, but ultimately turns it off.  He’s trying to think.

NORTHER WINSLOW

She’s swimming outside the car.  While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her.

Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten.  Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.

Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out.  But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him. 

EDWARD
I’ve seen him with women.  He flirts.  He always has.  On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother.  I just never had proof.
That’s nothing.  I once had to stay in bed for three years.

Edward shakes hands with his new boss, a TOUPEED MAN.  The company is called “Confederated Products.”  The OFFICE LADIES all love Edward.

Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister.

She hands him the ring.  Another beat, then Don storms off.  But not before decking Edward one last time.  

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

Will and his mother pick out one of Edward’s ties, for Will to wear at the funeral.  Will tries to button the cuffs on the shirt he borrowed, but they’re the kind that need links.
What does Dr. Bennett say?  Okay.  No, sure, let me talk to him.   I’ll wait.
Someone stole my backpack.
Fine, I will.

She puts her hand to the windshield.  He puts his up to meet hers.  And smiles.

After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing.  Relieved to see he’s not licking his chops --

He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.

She moves, trying to get out of the corner he’s boxed her into.  Once she’s finally free...

Sandra leans over Edward’s broken body.  His head lies on the daffodils.

Sandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine.

Eighteen.

Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl.  There’s a few tears amid the familiar faces.

SANDRA
Surprise ending.  Wouldn’t want to ruin it for you.
I’ve told you a thousand facts.  That’s all I do, Will.  I tell stories.

A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the equivalent of a U.S.O. show.  
Did you do any of that?
I’m robbing this place.

DON PRICE

The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his.  And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks into The Eye.

Amazed, Will turns to his father.

INT.  BLOOM HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

EDWARD

Suddenly, everything RUSHES.  The crowd becomes a blur, and the young woman is lost in its wake.  Now it’s Edward who’s frozen, helpless in time.

EDWARD
“You think _you’ve_ had a bad day,” she said.  “This morning the milkman dropped dead on the porch!”
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon.  Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita.  You were born a week early, but there were no complications.  It was a perfect delivery.  Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn’t the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can’t see as it would have been much different had he been there.  And that’s the real story of how you were born.

He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps slipping.

EDWARD

Will walks up the front steps.  There’s a subtle change to his expression, a dark cloud lifted.  He unlocks the door.

EDWARD

EDWARD (V.O.)

He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it.  The stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE’S NEST.  The swarm roars out.

JENNY
With these two hands, I reached in and snatched that fish out of the river.  I looked him straight in the eye.  And I made a remarkable discovery. 
With my prospects few, I took a job as a travelling salesman.  It suited me. If there’s one thing you can say about Edward Bloom, it’s that I am a social person.
Did you have chicken pox?

PING

He’s talking about his Hand Around the House.  We HOLD ON Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future.

INT.  GUEST ROOM - DAY
How can I convince you to stop?

DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded from coming down the stairs.  He was the town’s first Black physician.  He’s still the town’s best physician.

THE KEY TO THE CITY.

JOSEPHINE
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond.  This here is the ocean, and you’re drowning.  Take my advice and go back to Puddleville.  You’ll be happy there.

WILL

A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet.  We have no idea what they’re saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same.

Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling.

EDWARD
Then why’d you bring it?

This time we don’t cut.  Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he witnesses his death.  He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused.  Whatever he sees, it’s not as dire as the other boys.  His future has something strange in store.

WILL

Sandra stands by the window, watching as...
Sandra Templeton!  I love you!  And I am going to marry you!

EXT.  DIRT PARKING LOT - NIGHT
College!  She’s going to college!

Josephine smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him smiling too.  

A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors being paged.

JENNY
You’re a poet.  You oughta be able to.  And maybe if you’d seen more, you could.

INT.  BLOOM HOUSE FOYER - DUSK
Look, I can’t go back.  I’m a human sacrifice.  If I go back, everyone will think I’m a coward.  And I’d rather be dinner than a coward.

And then I realized, this wasn’t the end of my life.

Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.

Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.

Who the hell are you?

EDWARD (V.O.)

The family finishes eating breakfast off TV trays set up around the bed.  For his part, Edward is looking better.  Certainly not recovered, but there’s an optimism to his expression.  And for the first time, he’s actually hungry.  
Go out with me.

DR. BENNETT

He smiles, disbelieving.  It’s a real thing.
It’s bad.

Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him.

EDWARD

DOWN THE HALL
Good luck, kid.

EXT.  OLYMPIA CIRCUS - NIGHT
Dad?

With that, he begins to leaves.

SANDRA
How did you know?
What I mean is, do you really know what’s going on in his head?
Dad, you’re in no condition to...
He’s still here.  Let me buy you a drink.  I’ll tell you all about it.  Hell, I’ll have him tell you.

A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns.  Amid the crowd we see Don Price.
I’m eight.  That means when I’m eighteen, you’ll be 28.  And when I’m 28, you’ll only be 38.  
(loudly, for the crowd)

Will nods, just curious.  He continues heading up.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
You tell lies, Dad.  You tell amusing lies.  Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime.  They’re not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty.  And the thing is, I believed you.  I believed your stories so much longer than I should have.  And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you.  You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined.  Just as charming and just as fake.

The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he’s finished.  The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in.  The Emcee makes a “shoot him in the neck” motion to one of the ARMED GUARDS off-stage.

SCREAMS all around.  The skinny SECURITY GUARD makes a half-hearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off.  The guard takes out his gun and slides it over.
No, but I hear it’s terrible.  Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.

Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his fated love.  Not finding her, he becomes more frantic, running down the rows.

A sudden EXPLOSION as Edward is shot...

A long beat.  Then, deadpan...

DR. BENNETT
It’s okay, just leave it.

Norther doesn’t answer.  Just goes back to his notebook.

It’s half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no TV.  Will sets his keys on the table.

It’s morning, and the sun shines brightly.  Birds CHIRP.  Trees drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night’s rain.

Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.

With a sudden calm...

EXT.  THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]

I followed that fish up-river and down-river for three days and three nights, until I finally had him boxed in.

On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to the crowd.

EDWARD
When Norther made his first million dollars, he sent me a check for ten thousand.  I protested, but he said it was my fee as his career advisor.

He watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup.

He smiles, his teeth bloody.

Fine, I’m doing it.

At the elevators, Sandra and Josephine step out to find Will and Edward barreling straight at them.

Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot.

I’m the bad one.
No.  I’ve gotta meet somebody.  I’m already running late.
He ate an entire cornfield!

Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck.  The crowd CHEERS.  And with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go.

Will changes his shirt.  Takes his keys off the nightstand.
You think I’m fake.
Okay.

We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage.  He can’t steer.  He’s helpless.

You think I’m up for it?

WILBUR FREELY, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a sharecropper.  Redheaded RUTHIE MACKLIN, 8, is happy just to be there.

Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.

Will half-smiles.
I can get it.  I can just...

By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all.  The Key to the City dangles around his neck.  

Will looks in.  Empty.

HIS CAR,
Here, start with my hand.  It’ll be an appetizer.

What did you do?

A long beat.  Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it.  She’s a tangle of conflicting emotions.

INT.  TINY CHURCH - DAY  
I’ve travelled from Tennessee to Timbuktu, and if there’s one thing people have in common, is we could all use a hand around the house.

A half-broken sign lies in the road.  Edward picks it up.  Reads it:
I’m not going to hurt you.

Sandra is watering the garden.  Will (5) runs past her to greet Edward, just returned from another trip.
Did I ever tell you about how...
Okay.
Dr. Bennett.  It’s good to see you.

Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE.  The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than expected.

Amos smiles, amused.

He focuses his words on Sandra.  This story is -- and has always been -- about her more than anyone.

I had just left Ashton, and was on my way to discover my destiny.  Not knowing what that would be exactly, I explored every opportunity that presented itself.

She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house.  Hands it to him.  With a look, he thanks her.  Then goes.

She neatens his hair.  Holds his hand.  As she kisses his fingers, she tweaks her chin with them -- his signature move.
No one would come out here unless they had business.  And no one would have business with me except for you.  You’re buying the town.

The door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her 50’s -- the woman from the grocery store.  Her name is Jenny Hill.

He didn’t mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone’s laughing.

LITTLE GIRL
You’re pretty good at arithmetic.

Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn’t sad to see Edward go.  He crushes his cigarette under his heel.  He wishes he could crush Edward.

EXT.  COUNTY ROAD - DAY

But then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage.  The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins.  It’s just enough cover for Edward to remain unseen.
Would you mind grabbing that?

ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)

EXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY
The truth is, I didn’t see anything of myself in my father, and I don’t think he saw anything of himself in me.  We were like strangers who knew each other very well.

The tweedy ECONOMICS PROFESSOR continues his explanation.  Sandra isn’t paying a lot of attention.

Colossus is thumbing for a ride.  The last pickup truck stops and lets him climb in back.

INT.  STABLES - NIGHT

JOSEPHINE

Patting Will’s shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves.  We STAY ON Will and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and starts making a list.

He leans the door a different way.  It holds for a beat then falls in, SMASHING a small table.

He stares at himself in the reflection.  He smiles.

WILL

which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree.  As Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny piece of metal sticking out of the dirt.  He pulls it out, rubs it off.

Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl’s mouth.  But the giant spits it back out.
This isn’t how I die.

WILL’S DATE

JENNY

WARNING!  

Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a metal lava lamp.  Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five fingers and a thumb.  This is the Hand Around the House.(TM)

Wearing a white shirt and tie, YOUNG EDWARD -- still about 10 -- sings “Down to the River My Lord” along with the CONGREGATION.  His voice is high and thin, but he gives it his all.

PING

EDWARD (V.O.)

WILL

As the crowd of students APPLAUDS and CHEERS, we CRANE UP above the flowered battlefield.

As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see an Oldsmobile parking.
You need to go.

EDWARD
Edward, don’t!

Seeing SECURITY GUARDS heading their way, a quick-thinking Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down.

EDWARD

Edward shakes Karl’s giant hand.  They hug.

Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top.
Dad?

EXT.  SPECTRE - MAGIC HOUR

> TRANSITION TO:

EDWARD
How is that possible?  I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it’s another one of his stories.

Edward winces, but doesn’t say anything yet.  Digging through the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single deposit envelope.  He rips it open, revealing just a little cash inside.  Even some dimes and pennies.

BEAMEN
He ate my dog!

JENNY

Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand.  

Will’s rental car drives past a sign reading, “Ashton, 10 miles.”
And every day I gave him a quarter.  Every day.  Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks.  And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Only on the surface.  But that’s all I’ve ever seen.

He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage.  He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up.  Edward looks out at the sea of excited soldiers.  Every one of them would kill him.  He’s the legless cricket left on the anthill.

There’s nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might as well be asking for a Budweiser.  Still, Edward senses it would be best to do as he says.  He takes the guard’s gun.
You learned from the best.
Is it true she got a glass eye?

filters through soft sheets.  We’re under the covers, where a man’s hand traces the curves of a woman’s bare back.   A beat, then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be 
From that moment on, I no longer feared death.  And for that, I was as good as immortal.

Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd.  Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr. Bennett pull up.  Karl comes just after that.

EXT.  RIVER - DAY

He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it.  There’s a TITTER from the STUDENTS, but he doesn’t notice.

As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward.  He’ll never find that girl, the love of his life.
Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn’t the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?

Under a full moon, Edward feeds the animals.  
No, I understand.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - VARIOUS SHOTS

EDWARD

It’s then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.  No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming underwater.  We never see her face.
(calling out)

It’s a key.  It’s the Key to the City he lost years ago.

KARL

Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back where they’ve always been.  Edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain.  And LAUGHING.

JUMPING SPIDERS!
Look, I don’t know how much you want to know about any of this.  You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it.  Especially this late in the game.

Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave.  And then another.  His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, wondering what’s wrong.  Embarrassed, Edward just keeps SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.

EDWARD

His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.
Damn right you’re not. 
Ten thousand dollars is no fortune to most men.  But it was enough to buy my wife a proper house with a white picket fence.

EDWARD (V.O.)
My wife, Josephine.

INT.  BIG TOP - NIGHT

We LOOK OVER to find a nimble Edward sitting up in bed, combing his hair.  

Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town.

INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT  
Apparently I’ve overlooked this one piece of it, and I’d like to remedy that.  You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.  
(decidedly)

The hospital is so new, it’s not even finished -- thick plastic hangs from exposed framing.  There’s no one at the information desk, so Will forges ahead.
Son, I already told you.  You’re early.

HOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER
And when I’m 38, you’ll be 48.  And that’s not much difference at all.

Will doesn’t rise to the challenge.  A beat, then he remembers the can of Ensure.  Holds it up.  Edward recoils.

NORTHER WINSLOW

WILBUR FREELY

JOSEPHINE.

As Edward leaves, the door swings SHUT on its own.

Crossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out.  Strangely, he’s gotten even lighter.  Will carries him easily.

Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.

A classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up.  Written on the projector is “I Love Sandra Templeton.”  She’s horrified and excited at the same time.   The professor finally notices what’s written there.

INT.  BIG-TOP - NIGHT

EDWARD

EDWARD

Will flips to a new page.  The list keeps getting longer.
Lord, I’m sorry I...
Hello?  Mom?  Dad?

She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence.  Edward is breathless.  It’s the first woman he’s seen in her natural state, and he doesn’t dare move lest he frighten her away.

JENNY (V.O.)
I don’t want to eat you.  I don’t want to eat anybody.  It’s just I get so hungry.  I’m too big.

EXT.  THE ROAD - DAY
Make him stop.

WILL

Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.
Why, with this product you can...

He pulls at his collar.  Then pulls again, his face getting red.  Starting to panic, he loosens his tie.  He’s starting to undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself.  Two more buttons fly off.  One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.
(yelling)

We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood.  Edward kisses his wife.
Yes.
As it turned out, Sandra was able to keep her same date at the chapel.  Only the groom had changed.

DR. BENNETT

The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely visible over the door.  He shuts it to reveal himself to be 70.
Probably tonight.
She’ll make soap out of you!

Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet.  The chair nearly crashes into the back wall as the doors close.

A LAUGH from the crowd.  
After saying my goodbyes, I hopped three trains to get to Auburn that afternoon.

A troupe of STILT-WALKING FIREBREATHERS finishes their act to tremendous APPLAUSE.  

EDWARD

JENNY (V.O.)

Sandra waits outside the women’s restroom.  Her face is a study in strained composure -- acknowledging the inevitable but refusing to surrender to it.

JENNY
You can’t honestly say you know him.

Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.

INT.   BEAMEN’S HOUSE - DAY
If you ain’t gonna stop him Mayor, we will!

Eager to get off this subject...
That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice.

Will checks the address on one of his father’s files.
What did he say?

WILL

The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone.  She’s as gorgeous a woman as you’ll ever see.

WILL
(to the crowd)
I heard she got it from Gypsies.

She blinks slowly, just waking up.  Will is watching her.  He’s been up for a while.  We are actually...

Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together.  He hands them to Josephine.  She throws them up at the powerline.  They loop over.  APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

WILL (V.O.)

EXT.  QUAD - DAY

Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back.  He spots Edward walking back into the tent.

He was slipping her a little extra cream.

He smiles, remembering something.  On his fourth page, he looks up at his motionless father.   A beat, then we slowly

JENNY

Then he sees the snake.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DUSK
Fate has a way of circling back on a man, and taking him by surprise.  

And that’s the sad truth.  Karl is less a monster than a freak -- a giant man, but in the end, just a man.

His bare foot steps onto asphalt.

EDWARD (V.O.)
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I’m sure he did a lot of things he never talked about.  I’m just trying to reconcile the two.

QUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates:

Edward is startled.

As the MUSIC reaches a crescendo, we suddenly...
A pleasure.

It’s Amos Calloway.  Will doesn’t recognize him.

A beat.
(to Ruthie)

EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY

Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him.  As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other.  

EXT.  AUBURN UNIVERSITY - DAY

As the performers clear away, the circus’ owner-and-ringmaster AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands.  He may only be four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence.
Let’s get out of here.
One day, Edward Bloom left, and never returned to the town he’d saved.

Josephine emerges.

EDWARD

SANDRA

Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door.  As he leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...

Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie.  He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he’s never left the state.

MAYOR

EDWARD
Find yourself a nice girl!  Don’t trust anyone in Kentucky!  Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!

EXT.  ASHTON GAS - DAY

Dad, I’m about to have a kid of my own here.  It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.

She stands with her hips turned in profile.  Her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin.  The soldiers are on their feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING.
Just drink half the can.  I’ll tell her you drank the whole thing.  Everyone wins.

EDWARD

INT./EXT.  BLOOM HOUSE - (PRESENT) DAY

The crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river.  As he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.
In telling the story of my father’s life, it’s impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth.  The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.

Walking with her books, Sandra shakes her head, disbelieving.  We look up to the blue sky, where a giant sky-written heart floats in the wind.

AMOS
Music!  She likes music.  I like music too!

She nods, a bit more of a laugh.

> CROSSFADE TO:
Please.  Go.  Just go.

We follow Will, looking into his and Josephine’s room.  He aims for the guest room at the end of the hall.

It’s a cottonmouth, has to be.  It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.  There’s no decision to be made.  On pure instinct, Edward dives in.  He swims as hard as can, 

Edward takes a seat beside him.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

A DEEP VOICE

WILL
There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he’s made a terrible mistake.  The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.  

As we watch, Edward’s pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that’s how fast he’s growing.

Fair enough.  Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.

EDWARD

Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it’s too late.  A rifle-toting GUARD looks in.
And for that, it was all the riches a man could ever want.

WILL 

> CUT TO:

He judges her belly.

The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel.  We TILT UP to see this man is huge.

JOSEPHINE
That’s what she does, she makes soap out of people.

Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the Chevrolet.

As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.  The crowd APPLAUDS.

We DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking his head in the fountain.

AMOS

WILL (V.O.)

He climbs in his car and starts the engine.

JOSEPHINE

Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished.  She turns to face him.  Edward still doesn’t recognize her.
Yes, Will, I do.  And don’t presume things you don’t know.
Now tell me if that isn’t the best pie you ever ate.
I don’t got any batteries!
I won’t have mob violence in this town.  Now, has someone tried talking to him?
Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

EDWARD (V.O.)

EXT.  ROAD - DAY
You owe me three-fifty.

EDWARD

UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER.  The two men begin to SCUFFLE.  

A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes.  Fine.  Will cracks open the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.
You help my friend, okay?

...where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets, a kind of limbo.  A kiss good morning.  Legs entangling.  Neither wants to get up.
What’s a Gypsy?

The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the porch with their bags.  REVERSE to Will’s mother Sandra (53), surprised and a little annoyed. 

WILL (V.O.)

We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward’s reflection is caught in the dark water.  As the water ripples past, something changes.

Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a one-street town in the distance.  We pass a rusty sign...
Friend!

ON WILL AND SANDRA

Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.

JENNY
Open a jar.  Open a letter.  Scratch yourself while wearing mittens.  Hold a book.  Hold a baby.  Hold the dog away from kittens.  It’s strong enough, you can do a handstand with no hands at all.

Pretending to be her bitchy sister --  

Sandra drops the hose, letting it run on the lawn.
The maple tree and the Buick.  We heard it.

INT.  GUEST ROOM - NIGHT [PRESENT]

DR. BENNETT

This man is KARL, now 55.  He’s not 12 feet tall, but at least six-eight.
I’m going with you.

Edward drops down on the far side of the gate.  Truth be told, Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.  

AT THE CAR

Edward toasts the happy couple.  Josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.

He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out of the package.  It’s the mid-1960’s, but by the conservative dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think you’ve seen the _unusual_.  You may think you’ve seen the _bizarre_.  But I’ve travelled to the five corners of the world, and let me tell you, I’ve never seen anything like this.
Somehow, you’re better.  Different.  You’re getting ready to go.  And I say...

EXT.  JENNY HILL’S HOUSE - DAY TO NIGHT
I’m sorry.  It seems every hour I have to...

JENNY

She’s more amused than annoyed, but Will is entering dangerous territory.

EDWARD
I’ll offer you more than it’s worth.  And you know you won’t have to move.  Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.

SOME FARMER

EXT.  MAIN STREET - NIGHT
But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others. 

Will drives down a road that seems somewhat familiar.  And then we realize why:  a roadsign reads “Welcome to Spectre!”

WILL
It would kill you, huh?

MUSIC starts, a vampy torch song.  Ping sings melody while an off-stage voice carries perfect harmony.

The TELLER WOMAN nods.

EDWARD

ZACKY

JOSEPHINE

SANDRA
And the strange thing is, there’s not a sad face to be found.  Everyone’s just so glad to see you, and send you off right.

Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it’s a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 20’s, staring into the water.  He’s not just handsome, not just charming.  It’s as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him.

At her Sisters’ prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the second-story window to find the lawn filled with 

EDWARD
Over the months, I learned a lot about the woman I was going to marry, but not her name, and not where to find her.  That time had come.  I couldn’t wait any longer.
He was filling her basket.  He was making deliveries around back.  

It’s very early morning, and the first blue light of day is glowing through the vertical blinds.  Still in his chair, Will wakes up a bit at a time.  The notepad is on his lap, the pen in his hand.  

JENNY

just as it’s about to strike.

Looking over his shoulder, we see his father’s bed is empty.  The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.
Did you ever think maybe you’re not too big?  Maybe this town’s just too small.  I mean, look at it.

“Welcome to Spectre.”

Edward turns to see 
You can see my predicament.  My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
The first thing you have to understand, is that your father never meant to end up here.  And yet he did, twice.  The first time, he was early.  The second time, he was late.
Truth is, no one quite knew what was wrong.  Most times, a person grows up gradually.  I found myself in a hurry.

Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his entire weight on it.  The crowd APPLAUDS.

EDWARD

JING

JOSEPHINE
You’re seven months.

CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists. 

WILL

Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they’re in complete agreement.  They get the hell out of there.  Zacky would run too, but Don holds him by the collar.

Will lifts his father out of the chair.  

Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.

EXT.  SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards the crowd.

WILL 

As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches.  Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch.  Snakes slither through the marsh.

SANDRA
Now let me get this straight.  You’ll buy the swamp from me, but I’ll stay in it.  You’ll own the house, but it’ll still be mine.  I’ll be here, and you’ll come and go as you please to one place or another.  Do I have that right?

SANDRA
It truly is.

He finds a quarter, starts to dial.  He has to squint to see through the water in his eyes.   It’s ringing.  And ringing.  The other end answers.
You can’t reason with ‘im!

As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find “downtown” has been transformed.  Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold FIDDLERS.

As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with 

EXT.  A LONE HOUSE - DAY
Really.

Finally --

PING
People needn’t worry so much.  It’s not my time yet.  This isn’t how I go.

ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do.  He has a gun, but he truly doesn’t want to shoot Norther.  The Teller Woman is already waving him to the back.
Your momma’s a Gypsy.
I talked with your father last night.
How did you get here?

Will walks into the river, up to his knees.  He turns back so his father can face the crowd.  Edward waves.

WILL (V.O.)

TEN THOUSAND DAFFODILS.
That’s great.

EXT.  AMOS CALLOWAY’S TRAILER - NIGHT

As Edward continues, she can’t help but laugh harder, especially as the metaphors get more vulgar.

He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong.  What woke him up?
Go.

The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified that a man is coming at her.  

A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall.  Back down the stairs.

Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town in a tiny valley.

EXT.  OUTSIDE LA RUE 14° - NIGHT

Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-open door.  Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can’t see. 

AMOS

But Edward throws back the covers.

Day becomes night.
I know.  It was the same when I was carrying Will.  Like clockwork.

Strange to hear it put that way, but --
Would you say you understand Josephine?

Back to the main subject...

UNDER THE TABLE

SHEPHARD

The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom.  Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.

THE OLD WOMAN. 

Sitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels lonely, set deep in its lot.  Dapples of light break through the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches.

EDWARD

EDWARD
*Sometimes a girl can feel so alone*
Without a lover to call her own.
Sometimes it’s so bad, she wants to explode.
Wants to grab the first man she sees and tear off his clothes.

He decides he better go.

WILL

DON PRICE

WILL

WILL

EDWARD
It doesn’t always make sense, and most of it never happened.

Edward stands amid the sea of flowers.  He’s waited there six hours.

Amos hands off the contract to a CLOWN.

Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, and is about to knock when he notices it’s rocking.  A lot.  Not just that, there’s MOANING coming from inside.

EDWARD

He looks to his right.  Holds his gaze for a breath.

She’s dead serious.  Weighing the scales of chivalry, he finally backs away.  Turns and heads back towards his car.

INT.  FOYER - DUSK

EDWARD

Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road, no cars coming from either direction.  He looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, along with the rest of the town’s.

EDWARD

to his right, coming down the larger, paved road.

WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave.  His mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and practicality -- stands with him at the door.

It’s late, and Edward is pensive. 

Young Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various pulleys and levers to support his weight.  He has a dozen encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.
You can use it to point out important information.  Or dangers.  Or beautiful women.

EXT.  CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY  

EDWARD

CLOSE ON Edward’s hand as he turns knobs.
I think someone hasn’t.

EDWARD
To the day.

Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN (50) behind them.  A beat later, an identical face with glasses peers out -- the woman’s twin sister.  

JOSEPHINE

Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door.  Anything could jump out of them. 
I pick you up and you hardly weigh anything.  I can’t explain it.

We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk.  Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more heated.  Both men are a little drunk.

Finally, a decision is reached.  The door opens to reveal the woman of Edward’s dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton.  She’s effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight.
When I found this man, he was picking oranges in Florida.  His fellow workers called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow -- because when you were working beside him, he blocked out the daylight.  He could take a whole tree in his hands and shake off the fruit.  I had to pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I could take him with me.

EDWARD

JENNY (V.O.)(CONT’D)
I don’t have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one.  And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you’re ever going to meet.

The two women start to walk, no hurry.

EDWARD

WILL

Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward’s shoes.

The guard obeys.  Ping shakes her sister off.  Desperately flipping through his Asian phrasebook, he finds... 
He’s a monster!

The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos.  From FARMER to BAKER’S WIFE, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool.  Still, he’s having a blast.

The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.  She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him.  Although we’re VERY CLOSE, we can’t hear her voice.

As Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows.  He checks the number:  33.  This is the house.  It is surrounded by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother’s.  Will notices this.
True story.
What do you want, Will?  Who do you want me to be?

A ROAR from the soldiers.  She knows what they want.

AMOS

But Edward KNOCKS anyway.
He was buttering her rolls.  Pumping her churn.  Splashing milk in her box.

WILL

We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go.  She’s furious, but there’s something more in her feelings for him.  Something softer.

Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table.  We LOOK RIGHT, where the “MESSAGE” light blinks on the answering machine.
No, it’s okay!  I got it.  I got the snake.
Hardly two stories in the whole place.  Now I’ve heard in real cities, they’ve got buildings so tall you can’t even see the tops of ‘em.

Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt.  One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.  Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.
Please, I need your help.

CLOSE ON water SPLASHING into the claw-foot bathtub, which begins to fill.

JOSEPHINE
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.

He leans close to her, whispering in her ear...

It’s PING and JING.
(a simple fact)

He steps on the porch.  The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he continues on.  A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker.  Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.

Will sets him in the passenger seat.

EDWARD

He can’t believe he’s finally reached her.  He half-laughs, nervous.  That makes her laugh, not sure what’s going on.

Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a quieter moment.
There’s a fold-up wheelchair in the bathroom.  Wrap a blanket around me.  As soon as we get off this floor, we’ll be in the clear.
As for the girl, the common belief was that she’d become a witch, and crazy at that.  She became something of a legend herself.

AMOS

SANDRA
In so many words, yes.
Yes.  But that’s a different...
Now.  The thing about working for a circus is you don’t have a regular address, and after three years I had a lot of undelivered mail. 

NORTHER WINSLOW

Agreement from the crowd.  And then...

Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.

EDWARD (V.O.)

Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside.  Badly.

A beat.

WILL

Still fighting, Edward jumps for a pole on the far side of the catwalk, sliding down it to end up 

The Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination.  Edward feels horrible.

EDWARD

RUTHIE

A look to say, should I be worried?

SANDRA

THE CROWD (VARIOUS)

THE BEAST.

Sandra walks out to him.  She’s smiling, confused, joyful and scared.  All down Greek Street, STUDENTS are coming out to see the display.
My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.

EDWARD

JOSEPHINE
Dad?

JENNY (V.O.)

INT.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

KARL
A man sees things differently at different times in his life.  This town didn’t seem the same now that he was older.  
What happened to your shoes?

EDWARD
Those days, your father was working for himself.  If there was one thing you could say about Edward Bloom, it’s that he was a social person, and people took a liking to him.  One night he was returning from three weeks on the road, when he hit a thunderstorm unlike any in his life.
My muscles couldn’t keep up with my bones, and my bones couldn’t keep up with my body’s ambition.  So I spent the better part of three years confined to my bed, with the World Book Encyclopedia being my only means of exploration.  I had made it all the way to the “G’s,” hoping to find an answer to my gigantificationism, when I uncovered an article about the common goldfish.

EDWARD

At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting. 

PING

Still wearing his pajamas, Edward climbs into the tub.  Carefully lowers himself.
The tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup, which attracted the flies, which got stuck to it and flew off with the whole car.

He reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has it for him.  She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire glass, thirstier than he imagined.  While he’s drinking, we...

DR. BENNETT

Josephine almost GASPS.  She elbows Will, who turns to look.  From this angle, the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing steps forward.  They’re really two separate people.
I’m going with you.

The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns.  Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally

EDWARD
What, a father’s not allowed to talk about his son?

EDWARD

AMOS

We REVERSE to find FOUR KIDS looking in through the rusty iron gate with flashlights.  A beat, then they run away.
Sorry, kid.  I don’t do charity.
Do you like it, being pregnant?

JENNY

SANDRA

EDWARD
Everything here tastes better.  Even the water is sweet.  Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid.  At night the wind goes through the trees and you’d swear there was a whole symphony out there, playing just for you.

A VOICE (O.S.)

Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.   Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward.  It’s hard to hear over the MUSIC.
She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught.

Re-checking the number on a form he’s carrying, Will KNOCKS.  The piano stops.

WILL
Yourself.  Good, bad, everything.  Just show me who you are for once. 

BACKSTAGE.
Truly.  I saw it in The Eye.

EDWARD
You shouldn’t swear.  There’s ladies present.

JOSEPHINE
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We’ll miss you!

He brings the catfish up to his face.  Looks it right in the eye.  A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward’s gold ring.

SANDRA

EDWARD
Mr. Calloway!  It’s Edward Bloom.  I need to talk to you.
Stop.

His father is awake, silently GASPING for breath.  His eyes are open, scared and confused.
Most men in that situation would accept their failure and move on.  But Edward was not like most men.

INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT
Really?

EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTS

Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet.

Edward is chatting up Will’s pretty DATE to the homecoming dance.  She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward’s charisma.  He’s hypnotizing.

The first raindrops hit the windshield.  Edward turns on the wipers. 

INSERT:  The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.
We’re still working on that one.

Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it.  Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together.
What makes you think we’ll help you?  

As the water reaches the third button up on his pajama shirt, Edward suddenly slides 

A beat.

> CUT TO:
It’s a boy.

A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years:  BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.

INT.  AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT

RINGS THE DOORBELL.
Water.  I need water.

WILL
You don’t know me, but my name is Edward Bloom and I am in love with you.  I’ve spent the last three years working to find out who you are.  I’ve been shot and stabbed and trampled a few times, had my ribs broken twice, but it’s all worth it to see you here, now, and to finally get to talk to you.  Because I am destined to marry you.  I knew that from the first moment I saw you at the circus.  And I know it now more than ever.
Not to alarm you, Ma’am.  But if this man wanted to, he could crush your head between his toes.
